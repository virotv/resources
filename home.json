        "description": "We have partnered with our friend Billy Lewis the founder of ScareNetwork to showcase one of his horror film -  Jailhouse (Haunted Prison). Hope you will like this Horror Movie.\n\nPlot: Small town, the American dream. A blue-collar family living the idyllic rural lifestyle. Nothing is out of place save for the lacking white picket fence - and the old JAIL that occupies the 2nd floor of their century-old home. Seth Delray knew the possibilities before he moved his wife and two kids into the old jailhouse, but the Sheriff assured him that it would take an act of God to put that place back into service. Times were tight, and it was just too good of a deal to refuse. That is, until the county jail caught fire. The Sheriff's hands were tied and he had to put displaced inmates anywhere he could find iron bars with a locking door. The Delray house was his only option. For Seth the worst wasn't the criminals locked like animals in the soiled cages above his living room. It was the mortal fear in his children's eyes, it was the piercing cold looks from his wife. It was that deep, dark creeping recognition that something had happened there, something terrible, something that would grip his soul with hundred year old hands squeezing hate from unknown depths. No longer did the birds sing upon the morning lit branches beyond the barred windows of the old jailhouse. No one could know the confinement of such a place and the horror it brings... the bleak hopelessness of one without freedom... ...the inescapable iron bars of guilt and regret into which revenge imprisons a man's mind.\n\nWatch this scary psychological horror film Written and Directed by Billy Lewis the founder of ScareNetwork to find out what happens next.\nStarring : C.

The vehicle is wrecked, and there‚Äôs no mobile signal. Deciding to seek help, they venture through the woods and stumble upon a remote cabin. Inside, they find a strange Polaroid photo showing their accident, even though none of them remembers anyone taking pictures.\n\nConfused and frightened, they try to make sense of the situation. A nearby camera suddenly starts working on its own, producing new photographs. The photos depict horrifying scenes of their potential deaths.

        "description": "Motivational Drama | A girl from a poor family strives for a better life | Full English Movie\n\nStrive\n\nAmidst the vibrant streets of Harlem, a young woman's journey unfolds‚Äîa journey defined by dreams that seem almost unreachable but remain vivid and fiercely alive. Born and raised in the projects, she is surrounded by a world where opportunities feel scarce, and the future is often dictated by circumstance. Yet, she dares to defy the script that's been written for her. With a brilliant mind and a burning desire for more, she sets her sights on Yale, one of the world‚Äôs most elite universities. This goal, however, is no ordinary feat; it is a mountain she must climb against formidable forces‚Äîpoverty, prejudice, and the pull of a community where survival often outweighs ambition.\n\nHer days are filled with relentless challenges: navigating school with the weight of her family's expectations and struggles on her shoulders, sidestepping the temptations and dangers that loom in every corner, and confronting the inner fears that whisper she might not be enough. Her strength is tested by a world that tells her to settle, to accept what is given rather than reach for what seems impossible. But with each setback, she finds a deeper determination, a fiercer fight within her.\n\nMentors appear in unexpected places‚Äîteachers who recognize her potential, community members who offer quiet support, and even rivals who push her to refine her drive. As she balances academics, a job, and family obligations, she begins to understand that her journey is about more than just getting into an Ivy League school. It is about breaking cycles, redefining success, and becoming a beacon of hope for others who dare to dream. Through every obstacle, her spirit remains unyielded, and she learns that while the world may try to hold her back, the true power lies in her ability to keep moving forward, no matter how steep the climb. Each step brings her closer to discovering not only her path to Yale but also her place in the world, as a young woman who will not be defined by where she started but by how far she dares to go.\n\n\"Welcome to the 'Movie Marathon' channel ‚Äî your reliable guide to the world of captivating cinematic adventures!

The two youngsters form a close connection and spend two nights exploring LA's local food scene while their romance blossoms.\n\nDirector: William Lu\nWriter: William Lu\nStars: Julie Zhan, Kevin Ashworth, Michael Boucher, Michael Bow\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 5 March 2016 (USA) \nFilming Locations: Nvisionate Studios, Van Nuys, California, USA \n\nUser Review (IMDb.com):\n\n\"For everyone who is done with watching nightly escapades and immoral, provocative love, this tender movie is a tip. See the true romance, close by. Completed with a little humor and a bit of immersion.\n\nCourier Cameron (Chris Dinh) has to pick up one of his clients daughter of the airport: Jasmine (Julie Zhan). He is immediately charmed by her. And what does a crushing man do in a tender film? He does not actively open the hunt, no he buys a purple cuddle pony of one hundred dollars. Dating 2.0.\n\nTo see, or not to see? Comfort is a bit different than you are used to from the average romantic movie. Two adults who interact with each other in an extremely correct way. No l*st and wild behavior, but politeness and sincerity. I found it a nice movie, but there are some clich√©s in it and sometimes it's all too unrealistic and predictable. The bravery can sometimes be boring.\n\nParticularly see this movie if you are in the mood for something sweet and do not mind that the film is mainly about dialogue. The quality is good, so I still recommended it.\" Written by Lilian-van-Ooijen\n\n¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nFOLLOW US!\n‚úò Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Bjgtjme\n‚úò Twitter - https://twitter.com/Bjgtjme\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n‚ñ∫ Action: https://bit.ly/2BGettS\n‚ñ∫ Classic Movies: https://bit.ly/2Rf93Qt\n‚ñ∫ Horror: https://bit.ly/2ENC3be \n‚ñ∫ Western: https://bit.ly/2LzJWT9 \n‚ñ∫ All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EMLnMC\n\n#romanticfullmovies #watchmovies #moviesonline\n\n¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Immediately, both cannot shake the feeling that they have met before and that their chance encounter was not a coincidence. Gradually, they realize that they share an incredible past that they are now beginning to remember...\n\nReviews:\n\"This was a real gem. It was obviously an independent Film Festival entry. Especially since the two actors would have been known. It revolves around a man and a woman who must navigate between what is real or imagined, and whether they have become mentally unbalanced, or whether it is something else. Its a little too drawn out. Otherwise, I'd give it a 10, instead of a 9. Its more romance than SciFi. But it still holds your attention. The science aspect shows that there is more unknowns than knowns out there, waiting for us to discover. And that one would be a fool, to disregard the unknown. These two great young actors hold it together. The contrast between the two characters, also emphasizes the strangeness of the plot. Thank God, that there is someone out there, that still sees room for movies like this. We need to see more out of this Producer and Writer.\"\n- written by \"alanpgini\" on IMDb.com\n\n¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nSUPPORT US!\n‚úò Membership - https://bit.ly/399xKIq\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n‚ñ∫ Romantic Movies: https://bit.ly/2K0mm4E\n‚ñ∫ Classic Love: https://bit.ly/2IbLS4i\n‚ñ∫ All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2uGKy1G\n\n#romantic #freemovies #romanticmovies\n\n¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

        "description": "After the enormous success of 1938's \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", studios were hesitant to make Robin Hood films for fear of paling in comparison. Despite a few standalone adventures, this fear was dodged by a series of \"son of Robin Hood\" pictures, with the Prince of Thieves cast as the older, matured outlaw of days past, with their son the action hero played by a young up-and-comer. 1958's \"Son of Robin Hood\" introduced the twist that Robin Hood's daughter had come to claim her father's mantle, yet in a horribly predictable manner, a male character became the focus of the film very quickly, the titular son being a rouse.\n\nThe most recent of the child-of-Robin-Hood films, 2001's \"Princess of Thieves\" corrects this unfortunate direction, seeing Gwyn, the daughter of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, endeavour to break out of her monotonous life of study and inhabit the action and adventure she's heard so much about in her famous mother's life - despite her father's overprotectiveness, as Marian has since died. With Robin captured by the would-be-King John, Gwyn works to both rescue her father and find the true heir to Richard's kingdom, his son Philip, and place him on the throne. A twist on history, Philip of Cognac was a real, and only, child of Richard, though an illegitimate one who never inherited the crown, of course, much less had a remote chance to do so. But probably worse is the claim that Richard was king in 1184! Henry II would reign until 1189, with Richard only Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers during this time. Nevertheless, despite the TV-movie aesthetic, \"Princess of Thieves\" is a charming escape into the imaginary of Robin Hood.\n\nAll rights to Disney - shared here purely for fun!"

        "description": "In this action thriller from director Tony Scott, rookie train operator Will (Chris Pine) and grizzled veteran engineer Frank (Denzel Washington) learn that a runaway locomotive carrying carloads of dangerous chemicals is headed for Will's small Pennsylvania hometown, where his wife and child live. In order to save the day, they must figure out how to catch up to the rogue engine, and stop it before harm comes to the town. Standing in their way is Galvin (Kevin Dunn), the head of the company who is more interested in saving the stock price than lives. On the plus side, the duo have competent corporate employee Connie (Rosario Dawson) on the radio, talking them through their various attempts to corral and then stop the potentially lethal locomotive.\nDirector: Tony Scott\nWriter: Mark Bomback\nStars: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson\nUnstoppable is a 2010 American action thriller film directed by Tony Scott, written by Mark Bomback, and starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. The film, loosely based on the real-life CSX 8888 incident, tells the story of a runaway freight train, and the two men (Washington and Pine) who attempt to stop it. It was Scott's final feature film before his death in 2012.\nThe film was released in the United States and Canada on November 12, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on November 24, 2010. It received mostly favorable reviews from film critics; it garnered a \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based upon aggregated reviews,[6] and a rating of \"Generally favorable reviews\" at Metacritic.[7] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception."

Yash is a dutiful, responsible and stone-hearted police officer whose only passion in life is crime-fighting. He has no family or loved ones and has been alone in life since he can remember. Everything changes when Yash meets Maya (Genelia D'Souza), an independent and lovely woman. Though the two get off to a rocky start, Maya warms up to him once she realizes he is a police officer, and apologizes for the misunderstandings they had. When Maya gets hit by a car in front of Yash, he rushes her to the hospital. With that, the two bond and start to meet and go out regularly. Maya confesses her love to Yash, but Yash refutes her advances, as he does not want her to become his weakness in his professional life. However, Swati (Sandhya Mridul), the wife of Yash's coworker and friend, convinces Yash that he is in love with Maya as well and Yash decides to get married to her.\nIn the big drug case the unit is investigating, Yash, along with his co-mates, Mahesh Pande(Raj Babbar), Atul Kalseka (Mohnish Bahl) and Kamlesh, kill Reddy (Mukesh Rishi) while he is peddling drugs. Yash, Mahesh & Kamlesh are suspended for killing Reddy instead of arresting him. Reddy's heartless and aggressive brother Vishnu (Vidyut Jamwal) vows to avenge his brother's death by killing all of the officers, including Yash. Yash and the other officers prepare themselves for Vishnu, but Vishnu successfully intrudes into Mahesh's home and brutally murders him after raping his wife Rachana (Anaitha Nair). The event leaves Yash and the other officers shaken but Yash and Maya's marriage take place. Meanwhile, Vishnu decides to attack each of the officers' weaknesses; he kidnaps Swati, Atul's wife, and Atul is forced to tell him where Yash will be that night. Yash and Maya passionately enjoy their wedding night of love and bliss; however, this proves to be their first and last night together, as Vishnu and his henchmen invade the house and attack Yash and Maya the next morning.\nYash is fatally shot and Maya is kidnapped in the attack. Yash miraculously survives the attack. Vishnu tells Atul that he will release Swati if Atul kills Yash. However, Atul cannot bring himself to kill his friend and instead joins forces with Yash to execute a plan against Vishnu and save Maya and Swati. Yash, Atul and Kamlesh all go together to the place where Vishnu has been keeping Maya and Swati hostage and find, in horror, that Swati has already been murdered. In despair and heartbreak, Atul kills himself after seeing Swati's body. Out of the 4 police officers, only two are left now: Yash & Kamlesh. Yash and Kamlesh go together and face Vishnu in a final confrontation. Kamlash is shot but survives. Vishnu shoots Maya in front of Yash and drops her from the second floor. Yash catches her but is unable to save her. Maya assures Yash that she has gotten her wish of being with him and dies in Yash's arms. Anger and sorrow build up in Yash and he brutally finishes off Vishnu, exacting his revenge.\nAt the end, Yash is shown living alone again, having gone back to his professional life. Kamlash calls Yash and tells him that he has found a new informer. Yash turns to Maya's photo before leaving and says that he'll be coming home late tonight.\""

        "description": "TRUE STORY! The Best Criminal Drama üé¨ Movie in English\n\nRise (2014)\n\n\"Rise\" is a touching story of the fight for justice and survival in harsh conditions. A young man is falsely accused of rape and sentenced to six years in a maximum-security prison. His world falls apart as he loses his freedom, the trust of society, and his family. Forced to adapt to a brutal new environment, he learns that survival depends on strength, resilience, and wit.  \n\nIn prison, he meets a notorious criminal figure who unexpectedly becomes his ally. Despite their differences, a bond of mutual understanding and compassion develops between them. This unlikely alliance becomes crucial for the protagonist as they work together to uncover hidden evidence that could prove his innocence and restore his life.  \n\nThe film highlights the importance of dignity, inner strength, and faith in truth. The protagonist's journey takes him from despair to hope, from isolation to support, as he fights for his freedom and the restoration of his good name. **\"Rise\"** is a powerful story that reminds us that even in the darkest times, there is room for struggle and justice.\n\nDirector - Mack Lindon\n\nWriter - Mack Lindon\n\nStars - Jessica Green, Martin Sacks, Erin Connor\n\nDrama, Crime\n\n\nWelcome to our YouTube channel dedicated to the most thrilling films!

        "description": "Bad People (2016): Sketch comedy is back! If \"Key & Peele\" & \"Clerks\" had s*x, BAD PEOPLE would be their deranged child!\n\nDirector: Alex Petrovitch\nWriter: Alex Petrovitch\nStars: Bear Badeaux, Ken Bahn, Maria Falgione \nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 11 November 2016 (USA) \nFilming Locations: Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nSketch comedy is back! If \"Key & Peele\" & \"Clerks\" had s*x, BAD PEOPLE would be their deranged child! A quirky & smart dark comedy, bursting with s*x, violence, dirty politics & fame whores, BAD PEOPLE is a hilarious tale that reminds us that we all have a dark side! This soon-to-be cult classic slashes our corrupt society with several dark & n*sty short stories jam packed with silly & whacky characters! S*x-starved surfer girls seeking random guys online, crack addicted politicians, reality TV whores, religious scam artists, and more! BAD PEOPLE will have you p*ssing your pants for years to come!\n\nUser Review (IMDb.com):\n\n\"This is a series on non-connected comedy shorts interrupted by a news program reporting on a mayor involved in a drug and s*x scandal. The skits include a politically correct assassin, Internet dating, an actress, adopting parents, and friends with benefits. The themes tend to be lightly dark, slightly twisty and sometimes predictable.\n\nGood performances. Better than \"43\" and comparable to \"Groove Tube\" and \"KFM\".\n\nGuide: F-word. S*x. No nudity.\" Written by nogodnomasters\n\n¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nFOLLOW US!\n‚úò Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Bjgtjme\n‚úò Twitter - https://twitter.com/Bjgtjme\n\nMORE MOVIES! \n‚ñ∫ Action: https://bit.ly/2BGettS\n‚ñ∫ Classic Movies: https://bit.ly/2Rf93Qt\n‚ñ∫ Horror: https://bit.ly/2ENC3be \n‚ñ∫ Western: https://bit.ly/2LzJWT9 \n‚ñ∫ All Playlists: https://bit.ly/2EMLnMC\n\n#watchmovies #freefilm #fullmovie\n\n¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.

Single, and having the epitome of a successful life on paper but feeling that something is missing, Leah is moved to unexpected tears upon witnessing the beautiful hula dance of Ikaika, a kumu halau, on a chance encounter. Drawn to the feeling of that moment, she starts to take secret hula lessons from Ikaika - hiding her newfound pursuit out of worry that colleagues in her life may see hula as incongruous with being a respected financial executive. But this secret pursuit awakens something in Leah, and in learning more about the beautiful art of hula and the rich history and tradition at the heart of Hawaii, she also learns about her own heart, learns she really can fall in love, and is able for the first time to really find herself.\n\nDirector: Nanea Miyata\nWriters: Carolina Espiro, Nanea Miyata\nStars: Kelley Jakle, Cedric Jonathan, Peter Porte\n\nSubscribe to the channel for all our latest movie releases:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@NicelyEntertainment\n\nFollow us:\nFacebook: facebook.com/nicelyentertainment\nInstagram: instagram.com/nicelyentertainment\nWebsite: nicelyentertainment.com\n\nAbout Nicely Entertainment:\nNicely Entertainment is a production and distribution company bringing quality TV series and feel good family movies to global audiences and markets around the world.\n\n#fullmovie #movie #romance #comedy #film"

        "description": "Eddie Murphy gets way, way out in this futuristic sci-fi comedy.\n\nIn the year 2087, the Earth's natural resources have been largely depleted, and an increasingly large number of people have taken up residence on the moon, where the pioneering attitude of the new residents has created a culture not unlike the old west.\n\nPluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) is one such lunar exile who formerly made his living outside the law, but has since gone straight and now runs the hippest nightclub in the moon colony known as \"Little America.\"\n\nPluto is approached by Mogan (Joe Pantoliano), a gangster who wants to buy the nightclub. Pluto has no interest in selling, but it seems Mogan isn't about to take no for an answer. Pluto also discovers Mogan is in cahoots with Max Crater, a crime boss whose goal is to take over the entire moon.\n\nThe Adventures Of Pluto Nash also features Randy Quaid as Pluto's robot bodyguard, Rosario Dawson as a naive singer who has just arrived on the moon, Peter Boyle as Rowland the pool hustler, Jay Mohr as old-school lounge singer Tony Francis, Illeana Douglas as a cloning technician, and Pam Grier as Pluto's mother.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to ClipZone: Comedy Callbacks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5V8MdQsT_gLlw8rTyf7jVQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official ClipZone: Comedy Callbacks channel!

His life seems hopeless, but everything changes when he receives the old cell phone number of a famous basketball player known by the nickname \"The Saint\". Thanks to this number, he begins to receive VIP access to exclusive parties where he meets stars, influencers and eventually immerses himself in a world of wealth and luxury that he could only dream of before. His new lifestyle brings him not only pleasure, but also self-confidence. He enjoys all that celebrity life has to offer‚Äîthe attention, the luxury, and the seemingly endless opportunities.

This is one of the best Hollywood movies in HD that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter.\n\nüé¨ Is a cinematic adventure that challenges genre stereotypes, blending horror, comedy, and satire on modern culture. The story revolves around Blake, a struggling filmmaker who has dreamed for years of creating his masterpiece in the horror genre. His desire to turn his film into a cult classic finally becomes a reality, but not in the way he imagined. One day, he receives an unexpected offer that promises to fulfill his dreams, but with sinister consequences.\n\nüßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è After a mysterious virus spreads through Blake's small town, everything goes haywire. Instead of ordinary residents, the town is populated by undead with an insatiable appetite for flesh and strangely enlarged body parts. This turns the classic zombie apocalypse into an absurd and grotesque world where the threat seems so ridiculous that it even evokes sympathy for the characters.\n\nüé• Blake's horror film becomes a reality when the zombie virus spreads among the townspeople, and now he must use his cinematic knowledge to survive and save others. The situation spirals out of control, and as the zombies attack, the horrors Blake only imagined on screen become real-life nightmares.\n\nüòÇ The film is filled with moments that balance between fear and laughter, causing the viewer to experience anxiety and humor simultaneously. Constant tension is created through the comical reinterpretation of traditional zombie horror. Viewers are thrown into a whirlwind of absurdity as they watch the townspeople, along with Blake, try to overcome a threat that turns their lives into a grotesque farce.\n\nüé≠ Humor and satire are central elements of \"Fat Ass Zombies.\" Blake and his amateur friends are forced to admit that their reality has turned into an even more absurd film than the one they were trying to create. Each step leads to new challenges, each scene to new funny but also unsettling moments.\n\nüéûÔ∏è In the end, \"Fat Ass Zombies\" is a film that mocks our fears of the unknown, our dependence on pop culture, and modern beauty standards. Viewers simultaneously experience fear and a sense of absurdity, understanding that even in the most ridiculous situations, something comical can be found. Each scene in the film challenges our perception of reality, offering a fresh take on familiar horrors, making \"Fat Ass Zombies\" leave an unforgettable impression on those who dare to watch it.\n\nWelcome to our YouTube channel! \n\n‚úÖSubscribe to our channel so you don't miss new videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Cinema_Advanced?sub_confirmation=1\n\nüé¨ Dive into the world of cinema with us, where we curate a diverse collection of films across various genres.

Facing school bullies, a menacing dog named Chloe, and her bickering parents, Joy turns to prayer for help.

It explores different aspects of animal behavior, including hunting techniques and feeding habits, family elationships and defense mechanisms, courtship and mating rituals. \n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\r\n\r\nSubscribe Free Documentary - Nature Channel for free: http://bit.ly/2mFDC3Q\r\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\r\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\r\n\r\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\r\n#FreeDocumentaryNature #Documentary #WildOnes\r\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\r\nFree Documentary is dedicated to bring high-class documentaries to you on youtube for free.

Roaring, snorting, bucking, continuously reproductive en route, they head west - across the Serengeti from Tanzania to Kenya and back. With a large variety of animals in their wake - friend and foe: zebra families that resemble pale flotsam in a dark ocean amidst the gnu herds; or lions, and hyaenas in hope of their next victims. Along their way, they encounter hippopotami and crocodiles - and all of them embroiled in the cycle of \"devour and be devoured\".\nThe filmmakers follow the artiodactyls, armed with their cameras and lay in wait on the so-called \"birthing meadow\". There, in the world's largest maternity room, 250.000 calves will be born within the next three weeks. The journey from there to the pasture regions of Kenya is especially dangerous for young animals - and here the film also illustrates nature's harshness. And then there is the \"revenge of the gnus\", something that Vita and Rolf K√∂ster have become acquainted with. The two filmmakers gained unusual access to the world's most famous game reserve whilst shooting their film in search of the even-toed animals."

        "description": "Welcome to \"WILD SAVANNAH | The Migration Journey and Challenges in the Land of Predators\" an immersive wildlife documentary that plunges you into the vast, sun-drenched plains of the African savannah‚Äîan ecosystem as ancient as it is unforgiving. Known for its breathtaking landscapes and iconic wildlife, the savannah is a place where survival is both a daily triumph and a relentless challenge. From the towering baobab trees to the sweeping grasslands, this remarkable environment is a stage where life and death are in constant motion, shaped by the rhythm of the seasons and the instincts of the creatures who live here.\n\nIn this stunning documentary, you‚Äôll witness apex predators like the lion, the king of the savannah, as it leads its pride in the hunt, and the swift cheetah, nature‚Äôs fastest land animal, executing its high-speed chase. Alongside them, we‚Äôll explore the strategies of survival employed by other animals like the graceful giraffe, the powerful elephant, and the cunning African wild dog. Each species is uniquely adapted to the harsh realities of this ecosystem, where the fierce heat, limited water, and constant competition create a complex web of life.\n\nJoin us as we journey through the heart of Africa, delving into the remarkable survival stories that define the savannah. Marvel at how these animals navigate the delicate balance between predator and prey, strength and vulnerability.

Reptiles, such as snakes and sea turtles are also known to migrate. \nThe arctic tern, a bird, is believed to have the longest migration of any animal. It is known to travel some 71,000 kilometers  (or 44,000 miles) round trip from the arctic to the Antarctic every year.   \n\nMigration, Migration,\nMoving from station to station,\nWhen it‚Äôs time for traveling,\nMigration song is the song we sing‚Ä¶\nWhen they gotta‚Äô move,\nWhen they gotta‚Äô go quick\nAnimals are doing the migration trick,\nFlying, crawling, swim, or run,\ngotta‚Äô migrate towards food or sun‚Ä¶ \nMigration, Migration,\nMoving from station to station,\nWhen it‚Äôs time for traveling,\nMigration song is the song we sing‚Ä¶"

Thanks\n\nRead More below.!!!\n\nThe Great Migration\n\nSome 1.4 million wildebeest, 250,000 Burchell‚Äôs zebra and a smattering of trailing Thomson‚Äôs gazelle make the yearlong, round-trip trek from Tanzania‚Äôs Serengeti to the Masai Mara in Kenya. The herds make the 1,200-mile oval circuit with two things in mind: food and water. ‚ÄúThe smell of rain and sound of thunder spur the migration forward, but sometimes sideways and even back,‚Äù says David Bromham, senior Private Label Guide for A&K East Africa. Along the way, many migrating animals become prey to predators including lion, cheetah, crocodile and hyena.\n\nIn fact, around 250,000 wildebeest and 30,000 zebra perish in this tough trek, mainly younger ones. ‚ÄúMany times, mother wildebeest will just start running and keep running, not knowing that their young can‚Äôt keep up,‚Äù says David, an A&K Professional Safari Guide in Tanzania with 26 years of experience. That is one wildlife encounter to witness among many during a visit to East Africa, where the Great Migration‚Äôs mind-boggling scope and raw beauty are on full display throughout the year.\n\nThe Path of the Migration\n\n1. January - March\n\nThe migration begins in the Serengeti. ‚ÄúWildebeest tend to congregate in February, when they give birth to 300,000 calves,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúThe reason for concentrating in the south is to give their calves the richest milk, as the soil and grass is rich in potassium, calcium and phosphorus from the volcanic eruptions of two to three million years ago.‚Äù Joseph adds: ‚ÄúThe southern part of the Serengeti has short grass, so wildebeest prefer to calve here, without fear of predators that typically lurk in taller grass.‚Äù\n\n2. April - May\n\n‚ÄúBy April,‚Äù David says, ‚Äúmost of the grass is gone.‚Äù As the Serengeti starts to dry up, the herds follow the Grumeti River west.\n\n3. June - July\n\n‚ÄúBy June the Grumeti River is low, often leaving crocodile infested pools as the only water source in the area, and both wildebeest and zebra drink almost three gallons daily,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúCome July, the main body is in and around Ikorongo and Fort Ikoma. At this time, the herds also hasten their approach to the Masai Mara as the reserve receives rain from Lake Victoria, about 70 miles away.‚Äù\n\n4. August - September\n\nThe main mass reaches the Masai Mara, and the river crossings begin. ‚ÄúAugust is probably the best month to catch a crossing, but take a book and plenty of patience as it is a waiting game,‚Äù says David. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre lucky, you may witness three or four high-drama crossings in one day. The feast-or-famine crocs lick their chops for four months of the year in total, though they can survive on fish and the fat in their tails for a year or more.‚Äù\n\n5. October - December\n\nThe herds turn the corner and head back toward the Serengeti, as the rainy season starts in Tanzania. ‚ÄúBy early October the Masai Mara grasslands are pool-table flat,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúNow, the million-beast march starts the winding journey south, consuming approximately 5,000 tons of grass a day.‚Äù\n\nCredits: national geographic"

        "description": "Every single year, billions of animals, large and small, take on epic journeys via water, air and land. Weather to mate, search for food, or move to a warmer climate, these journeys are often fraught with danger but are ultimately rewarding.\n\nWe‚Äôll show you that animals go to extraordinary lengths to ensure the survival of their species. Covering topics like the Monarch Butterfly, the Pink Flamingo, and the Emperor Penguin...brought to you by Zero2Hero.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe! https://goo.gl/NXuChu\n\nAlso, check out AMAZING mysterious discoveries of South America!! https://youtu.be/RBh9YTMUmcE\n\nNumber 10: monarch butterflies.\nYes, I said butterflies‚Ä¶Each year, millions of butterflies travel south for the winter.  The only insect migration of its kind sees these creatures cover large distances as they search for a more temperate climate. \nFlying from the Rocky Mountains in the USA and Canada they travel south to Mexico. And, strangely, if they are from the eastern states of the US they travel west to Pacific Grove California, a journey of around 2,500 miles. \nWhen they arrive, exhausted, they look for trees to hibernate in. In Mexico, they choose the Oyamel Fir trees, covering them completely in a blanket of bright orange butterflies, and in California, they choose Eucalyptus trees. \nTraveling around 50-100 miles a day, flying at speeds of 15-20 mph, these butterflies use thermal air currents to help them along, as it can take them 2 months to finally reach their destination. But that‚Äôs not the end of it either, as they travel all the way back to whence they came‚Ä¶once the winter is over!\n\nNumber 9: The Sardine Run.\nMoving from the air to the sea, the Sardine Run is a huge gathering of, believe it or not‚Ä¶sardines, or actually, Southern African Pilchards. \n\nThese fish gather in the billions to spawn in the cooler waters of the Agulhas Bank, before moving north along the coast of South Africa towards Mozambique and eventually heading out into the Indian Ocean.\nWith shoals that are often more than 4 miles long, 1 mile wide and 1000 feet deep, this gathering itself, acts a draw for other far smaller migrations of large ocean hunters on the lookout for a good meal. Creating feeding frenzies wherever these small fish go. \nPredators such as sharks, dolphins, and humpback whales all zero in on the billions of fish from below while birds, such as Cape Gannets, attack from above. But these fish gather in such vast numbers that the predators cannot get them all. \nAnd so, spawning in this massive way helps ensure the future of the species.\n\nNumber 8: Green Sea Turtles.\nStaying in the salty blue, but this time following thousands of endangered Green Sea Turtles.  As each year the female turtles return to the beaches they were hatched on. \nFor some this means returning to Costa Rica‚Äôs tortuguero National Park, for others it‚Äôs the remote islands along the great barrier reef. \nRegardless of where they are heading, they will all travel great distances through the dangerous open ocean to locate the very beaches that they swam into the oceans from when they hatched. They haul themselves up onto the beach, find a suitable location, dig a hole and lay up to 100 eggs, before burying them safely away and slipping back into the ocean. \nAgain, in doing this they are putting themselves at risk, because just like with the sardines, their predators also know of this event and the female turtles are often met by the ragged teeth of sharks. \nBut so long as their eggs are safe, it‚Äôs all worth it once they hatch.\nNumber 7: wildebeest.\nDriven by a need to eat, up to 1.5 million wildebeest follow the rains across Africa each year, they are often joined in this endeavour by thousands of zebra and numerous other herds of grazing animals. I‚Äôll wait for you to finish singing the Toto song in your head‚Ä¶or maybe it was Ninja Sex Party?\nAnyway, they arrive shortly after the rains fall on the southern Serengeti in November and December. Feeding on the fresh green grass they will stay in this location until around March. But keep in mind that most of the females had calves in February, drawing a lot of attention from the lionesses, leopards and cheetahs on the plains. As their newborns gain strength and the grasses begin to die off the herds start their journey north in April and May. \nBy June the animals reach start to hit some dangerous parts of their journey, the Grumeti River, while at this time of year is mainly pools it only slows the progress of the herds and is another area where predators will lay in wait. By September as they continue to travel even further north they hit the Mara River, causing them serious problems. The young face the risk of being dragged away in the swollen river by the currents and drowning, but there are also hundreds of crocodiles waiting for an easy meal."

This secret society, created\nin 1865, has survived throughout the decades and has always managed to rise from its ashes.\nIt has been making the news for over 150 years. 150 years of hatred, racism and horror. A\ncruel history whose demons still haunt America.\n\nPart 1: \nIn 1865, a handful of Southern Civil War veterans founded a secret society: the Ku\nKlux Klan. Very quickly, the Klan instituted a reign of terror among the recently freed black\npopulation. Murders and lynchings were common. In Washington, Congress launched an\noffensive against the invisible empire, which was officially destroyed in 1872. The Ku Klux\nKlan was reborn in 1915 thanks to the film The Birth of a Nation by D. W. Griffith. Under new\nleadership, it evolved to fit into an America undergoing major changes and broadened its\ntrade in hatred. The KKK became anti-immigrant, anti-urban, anti-communist, anti-Semitic,\nand anti-Catholic. Nearly four million Americans joined what would become a highly\ninfluential mass lobbying organization. But at the end of the 1920s, scandals and the\neconomic crisis weakened the movement, which eventually disappeared again after the\nSecond World War.\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\nSubscribe Free Documentary - History Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2FjRPgV\n\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #AmericanHistory\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\nFree Documentary - History is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

The same day, special units loot the headquarters of French Masonic Obedience. By order of Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi Party theorist, obsessed with the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory, they collect tons of archives and precious books and they ship them to Berlin. The aim is threefold: identifying all French Freemasons, highlighting the anti-fascist political networks and finding a hypothetical esoteric secret held by freemasons. Why Nazis, the day they invaded Paris, made the looting of archives in the two main Masonic lodges one of their main priorities? Why, later on, the powerful KGB decided, by order of the Kremlin, to steal this unusual loot from the Germans? To run the investigation and elucidate the facts, Emmy-award winner Jean-Pierre Devillers will rely on two journalists and a group of freemasons and historians. In particular he will follow the work of American expert Patricia Kennedy Grimsted.

        "description": "Freemasonry and the Knights Templar are both fraternal organizations, but they have different origins and beliefs. \n\nFreemasonry is a fraternity that traces its origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons, which from the end of the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. These fraternities were composed of stonemasons who were working on the construction of the great cathedrals and castles of Europe. They developed a system of moral teachings and a code of conduct that was passed on to new members through a series of rituals and ceremonies. Over time, these fraternities evolved into a more speculative organization, which came to be known as Freemasonry. Today, Freemasonry is a fraternity that is open to men of good character who believe in a Supreme Being. It is a fraternity that emphasizes personal development and self-improvement through a system of moral teachings and symbols.\n\nOn the other hand, The Knights Templar were a medieval Christian military order founded in the 12th century. The order was created to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. The Templars quickly grew in power and wealth, and they became one of the most powerful organizations in Europe. They were also known for their secrecy and their distinctive white mantles adorned with a red cross. The order was dissolved by Pope Clement V in the early 14th century, and many of the Templars were arrested, tortured and executed.\n\nWhile Freemasonry uses the imagery and symbology of stonemasonry as a metaphor for personal development, the Knights Templar were a religious order. Some people believe that Freemasonry has its roots in the Knights Templar, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Some conspiracy theories suggest that the Templars went underground after the suppression of their order and that they became the basis of the Freemasons. But there is no historical evidence to support this claim. Furthermore, the principles and beliefs of the two organizations are vastly different. The Knights Templars were a religious order and the Freemasonry is a fraternity, with no religious connotation, but it requires its members to have a belief in a Supreme Being.\n\n#knightstemplar #freemasonry #conspiracy #documentary \n\n----  \nInteresting links and sources:  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Freemasonry\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Freemasonry\nhttps://www.history.com/news/freemasons-facts-symbols-handshake-meaning\n----\nThis channel offers you full episodes of high quality documentaries.

        "description": "When most of us hear the word ‚Äúfreemason‚Äù we usually think of a band of brothers that stretches across the world, a fraternity of moneyed men who engage in strange rituals and greet each other with a secret handshake. These people belonging to this mysterious nexus believe in a higher power and together they share secrets and protect each other. And when they meet at the lodge they do so with the doors closed to the world. What happens at the lodge stays at the lodge. The Master leads the ceremonies, and what he says will never become public knowledge. The fact freemasonry is shrouded in so much secrecy does of course elicit us non-freemason to be curious, so today we‚Äôll try to separate the facts from the myth in this animated educational cartoon\n\nüîî SUBSCRIBE TO US ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/c/theinfographicsshowOFFICIAL?sub_confirmation=1\n\nüîñ MY SOCIAL PAGES\nDISCORD ‚ñ∫https://discord.gg/theinfoshow\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/TheInfographicsShow\nTwitter ‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/TheInfoShow\n\n\nüí≠  SUGGEST A TOPIC\nhttps://www.theinfographicsshow.com\n\n\nüìù SOURCES:\nhttps://pastebin.com/sMscKV8M"

Slowly push them, and they won‚Äôt fall off. This shows the principle behind coin-pushing machines.  \n\n2. Rainbow Rose: Split the stem of a rose into four sections. Place each section in a different colored dye. After some time, you‚Äôll get a rainbow-colored rose. This is called capillary action.  \n\n3. Floating Top: Place two bottle caps on a magnet, then spin a top on a plastic board. Slowly pull out the board, and the top floats in the air. This explains magnetic levitation trains.  \n\n4. Water Cushion: A fragile bowl that usually breaks with a single tap can have a hole punched in it underwater without breaking. This demonstrates water‚Äôs cushioning effect.  \n#science #experiment #scienceexperiment #sciencefacts #scienceandtechnology"

        "description": "Was life on Earth ever like a fairy tale? Perhaps if you go back a hundred million years ago, in the Cretaceous period. How else to call the mysterious impenetrable thickets of lush forests and ferns taller than a person? And most importantly, the absolutely unimaginable monsters that roamed these thickets?\nWe know that dinosaurs lived there. And at the end of the Cretaceous period, the ancient reptiles reached their highest peak. For example, scientists from the University of California counted 2.5 billion tyrannosaurs over the entire period of their existence. These dinosaurs are considered the most aggressive and successful predators of all time. But there were also dinosaurs with horns, hooves, duck beaks, huge crests on their heads, and bizarre bone collars on their necks, not to mention thousands of teeth. Some of them may even have emitted flames from their nostrils like fire-breathing dragons. However, this scientific hypothesis hasn't yet been proven.\nWell, scientists have no doubts about the monstrous size of some reptiles. In China's northern province of Hebei, a group of paleontologists has unearthed about 4,300 dinosaur footprints. There were leg prints that reached several meters! This is a bit less than a Ford Focus car. According to scientists, the giants were over 15 meters (50 feet) long. Just like a railroad car! But there‚Äôs so much more that dinosaurs could surprise us with!\nWhich of them were similar to chimeras that seemed to be several creatures at the same time? Why did one of the dinosaurs need horrendous meter-long claws like Freddy Krueger? And which of the flying reptiles had a wingspan that reached the height of a two-story building?\nWe invite you to immerse yourself in the incredible ancient world of the Cretaceous period. And get to know who inhabited the Earth during the last brightest era of dinosaurs.\nDinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous.\n#Cretaceous #dinosaurs #reyouniverse"

Imagine a single massive continent, Pangaea, dominating the landscape, surrounded by a colossal ocean called Panthalassa. This supercontinent was home to an astonishing array of creatures, including the mighty dinosaurs, which roamed the land in all their formidable glory.\n\nAs we delve into this ancient era, we'll explore the lush, dense forests that blanketed much of Pangaea and the diverse ecosystems they supported. The air buzzed with the calls of ancient creatures, and the ground trembled under the weight of dinosaurs like the towering Brachiosaurus and the fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\nNot to be overshadowed by the drama on land, the prehistoric seas teemed with life. Enormous marine reptiles like Plesiosaurs and Mosasaurs prowled the waters, while schools of ammonites drifted gently in the currents, and gigantic ichthyosaurs dominated the oceanic food chain.\n\nThis journey through prehistoric Earth will not only cover the well-known giants of the Mesozoic era but will also shed light on some of the lesser-known aspects of this ancient world, from the microscopic organisms that formed the base of the food web to the massive volcanic activities that shaped the environment and the climate.\n\nSo, let us step back in time and unravel the mysteries of a world long gone, discovering how these ancient environments and their inhabitants laid the foundations for life as we know it today. Join us as we explore planet prehistoric, a time capsule of evolution, extinction, and the enduring legacy of the dinosaurs.\n\nBeyond their appearance and extinction, dinosaurs are a source of endless fascination due to the strange and sometimes bewildering facts that research has unearthed. For instance, some dinosaurs, like the Stegosaurus, had brains the size of a walnut, significantly small in comparison to their massive bodies. Others, such as the Parasaurolophus, had elaborate crests on their heads that could have been used for communication or to attract mates. The discovery of dinosaur fossils with preserved feathers has revolutionized our understanding of these creatures, suggesting a closer evolutionary link to birds than previously thought.\n\n\nThe Proterozoic eon witnessed significant geological and biological transformations. This period marked the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, a direct result of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria. The \"Great Oxygenation Event,\" which occurred around 2.4 billion years ago, radically altered the planet's atmosphere, paving the way for more complex life forms. The Proterozoic also saw the first supercontinent, Rodinia, form and break apart, a cycle that influenced global climate and environmental conditions conducive to evolution.\n\nBy the late Proterozoic, around 600 million years ago, the first multicellular organisms began to appear, with the Ediacaran biota representing some of the earliest complex life. These creatures were predominantly soft-bodied, living in the deep sea environments of Earth's pre-Cambrian oceans. They lacked the hard, mineralized skeletons that would become commonplace in later eras but represented a critical step in the evolution of life.\n\nTransitioning into the Phanerozoic eon, the Paleozoic era, specifically the Cambrian period, known for the \"Cambrian Explosion,\" saw a dramatic diversification in life forms. This period, beginning around 541 million years ago, marked the emergence of most of the major groups of animals and the first occurrence of a predator-prey dynamic. The Cambrian Explosion set the biological stage for the development of ecosystems that could support the eventual rise of dinosaurs in the subsequent Mesozoic era.\n\nThe pre-dinosaur world is a testament to the dynamic and ever-changing nature of Earth, showcasing a history rich with climatic shifts, tectonic movements, and evolutionary innovations. Understanding this period provides valuable insights into the conditions that led to the rise of dinosaurs and helps contextualize the ongoing story of life on our planet.\n\nThe extinction of dinosaurs, about 66 million years ago, remains one of the most intriguing topics in paleontology. This catastrophic event, believed to be caused by a combination of volcanic eruptions, climate changes, and the impact of a massive asteroid, led to the end of the Cretaceous Period and paved the way for the rise of mammals."

It moves with stealth and precision, closing in on its unsuspecting prey.]\n\nNarrator: With unmatched speed and agility for its size, the T-Rex would often ambush its victims, delivering a fatal blow with a single strike of its powerful jaws.\n\n[T-Rex launches into a sprint, closing the distance between itself and the Triceratops. The herd scatters in panic, but one unfortunate member is unable to escape.]\n\nNarrator: In the eternal struggle for survival, the Tyrannosaurus Rex reigned supreme as the ultimate predator of its time.\n\n[The T-Rex delivers the final blow to the Triceratops, its triumphant roar echoing through the ancient landscape as it claims its prize.\n\nNarrator: And though the mighty Tyrant King may have vanished from the earth millions of years ago, its legacy lives on as a testament to the power and majesty of prehistoric life.\n\n[Closing shot of the T-Rex standing triumphantly over its fallen prey, the sun setting behind it as it fades into the shadows of history.]"

This video was taken from the plane window during the viewing of the lines. The weather was absolutely perfect, as it usually is in this part of the desert. From out of no where, the plane was overtaken by a large dark dense set of clouds. The passengers described fear as the captain of the plane asked them to brace themselves against the immenent turbulance. The small craft was soon entirely engulfed by the clouds. The man videoing the Nazca Lines kept the camera rolling as they passed through the clouds. Unknown to the tourist was the disk that passed   \r\nunsafely close to the plane. He did not notice it until they returned to their room later on in the morning and viewed the tape. He was so shocked at what he had seen that he uploaded segments of the flight and shared them to be viewed by others. At this time the tourist is still in Peru for another 10 days and will not be available for questions until he comes back to the US."

        "description": "Full Video : https://youtu.be/pH4zrGEqT7U\n\n\n\nDiscover the fascinating differences between life in space and on Earth! In this video, watch astronauts as they navigate zero gravity, conduct experiments, and adapt to life aboard the International Space Station. Then, see how they transition back to Earth‚Äôs gravity, including the physical challenges and emotional experiences of returning home. A must-watch for space enthusiasts, science lovers, and anyone curious about the effects of space travel on the human body and mind!\n\nIn space, astronauts face incredible challenges, not just in terms of their daily tasks but also their physical well-being. One of the most significant effects of being in a microgravity environment is muscle atrophy. Since there is little gravity in space, astronauts‚Äô muscles, especially those used for movement and supporting the body on Earth, don‚Äôt need to work as hard. This leads to a decrease in muscle mass and strength, which can be especially tough when they return to Earth. Astronauts undergo extensive physical therapy to rebuild strength and regain muscle function after months of being in space.\n\nFor those wondering how they use the restroom.: Without gravity, traditional toilets don‚Äôt work the same way. Space toilets are equipped with specialized systems that use air flow, seat restraints, and vacuum technology to ensure that waste is properly contained and doesn‚Äôt float away. It‚Äôs a fascinating and essential part of space missions that keeps astronauts comfortable and healthy while they‚Äôre in orbit\n\n#SpaceExploration #Astronauts #LifeInSpace #EarthVsSpace #ZeroGravity #InternationalSpaceStation #SpaceScience #NASA #SpaceTravel #HumanBodyInSpace #ScienceExplained #SpaceDocumentary‚Äù"

In this image, Earth appears as a tiny, pale blue speck against the vastness of space, barely visible in a ray of scattered sunlight. Suggested by astronomer Carl Sagan, the photo was intended to show Earth's fragility and insignificance in the immense cosmos. Sagan famously described Earth as \"a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam,\" highlighting how, despite its small size in the universe, it is the only known home to life. This profound perspective reminds humanity of its unity, urging us to cherish and protect our planet, our \"pale blue dot,\" as we explore beyond.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer: -\n\n Under section 107 of the copyright Act 1976, allowance is mad for FAIR USE for purpose such a as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship and research.

The first one was only identified in 1971, and black holes were not photographed until 2019! Black holes are not empty space: a black hole represents the greatest concentration of mass anywhere in the universe. So, if black holes are so hard to observe, how do we know about them at all? Black holes have a large impact on space and astronomical objects around them.\n\nLike this video if you want to see more videos about SPACE!\n\nSubscribe to FreeSchool: https://www.youtube.com/user/watchfreeschool\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/watchFreeSchool\n\nOr check out our website for more content: http://www.freeschoolpublishing.com/"

Question one: Could black holes be portals to other universes? Just imagine... these mysterious cosmic monsters devour absolutely everything, not even allowing light to escape. But here's the mind-bending part - all that swallowed matter seems to vanish into a point where our laws of physics simply stop working. Question two: Is space truly infinite? Every time we think we've seen it all, our telescopes reveal more galaxies, more stars, stretching endlessly into the darkness. But if space never ends, doesn't that mean every possible reality must exist out there somewhere? Final question: Is another ET watching us right now? For over a century, our messages have been silently traveling through space, passing countless unknown worlds. Right this second, they continue their journey deeper into the cosmos. What intelligent eyes might be studying these signals, and more importantly... what might they be thinking? Some questions make us think. Others make us wonder. But the greatest questions... do both."

        "description": "No other place is as charged with myths, legend and secrets than Neuschwanstein Castle. The childhood dream of a young prince became the most exciting building project in the world, when \nthe foundation stone of the castle was laid on September 5, 1869. Today, Bavaria's most famous building is inextricably linked to the fate of its builder, King Ludwig II. \"The sudden death of the king gave the castle a brilliant start in its career as a tourist attraction,\" says Ludwig, Prince of Bavaria, a relative of the fairy-tale king. \"It's a built fantasy. You're not in a house, you're in a dream.\"\n\nEven when it was built, the castle seems to have fallen out of time. It's the perfect symbiosis of high-tech and medieval. The feeling of not being understood and accepted caused the monarch to slip into ever more enraptured dream worlds. Neuschwanstein became his last refuge.\n\nKing Ludwig II. was denied the opportunity to live in his palace in its completed state. On June 12, 1886, he was arrested. The mysterious death of the King in Lake Starnberg a few days later makes the \"fairytale king\" legend. Six weeks after his death, the castle was opened to visitors, partly to prove how \"crazy\" the king was.\n\nFor decades, the castle lay dormant. It survived two world wars unscathed, misused by the Nazis during the Third Reich as a warehouse for looted art. At the end of the Second World War, US troops reached Neuschwanstein. The castle finds itself on the list of must see sights for GIs stationed in Germany. And so photos of the Bavarian dream castle enter the living rooms of many Americans. On this History Stories special, we reveal the secrets of the castle that became a symbol for a different Germany and immortalized in Disney's Sleeping Beauty. \n\nFor more visit: https://www.dw.com/en/culture/s-1441\n‚Æû Follow DW Culture on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/dw.culture\n‚Æû Follow DW Culture on Twitter: twitter.com/DW_Culture\n\nPlease follow DW's netiquette: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G\n#dwhistoryandculture #neuschwanstein #bavaria #ludwig \n\n00:00 Intro\n01:42 The Castle of Ludwigs childhood\n05:44 Ludwig becomes the King\n08:50 The idea of the Castle\n16:03 The construction \n20:20 The Rooms and Wonders of the Castle\n30:47 Financial Problems\n36:04 The Mad King Ludwig?\n38:19 The Mysterious Death\n43:40 Ludwigs Legacy\n50:45 Outro"

Built in the 13th century, it sits atop a cliff in a remote area, far from any trade routes or defensive lines, which is unusual for medieval castles. Its primary purpose remains unclear, but legend suggests it was constructed to seal a gateway to hell. According to local lore, a deep, bottomless pit existed beneath the castle, from which terrifying creatures and foul odors emerged. To prevent the spread of evil, the castle was built directly over this pit, with a chapel placed on top to suppress its dark power.\n\nOne of the most unsettling stories surrounding Houska Castle is about a condemned prisoner who was offered a pardon if he agreed to be lowered into the pit to report what he saw. When he was pulled back up, he was reportedly pale, aged by several decades, and incoherent, claiming to have seen horrifying visions.\n\nDespite these tales, the castle lacks many of the typical features of a defensive structure, such as kitchens or water sources, leading many to believe it was never meant for habitation but rather for containing the supernatural. Today, Houska Castle is a popular tourist attraction, with visitors reporting strange occurrences like sudden temperature drops and ghostly apparitions. Its mix of history and legend has made it a focal point for those interested in the paranormal."

He is a paranormal investigator and demonologist. He researches the existence of ghosts and spirits and investigates paranormal activities by visiting different places. He also travels to places containing myths and figures out whether these stories have any truth.\n\nAmazon: https://amz.run/6Pjp\n\nAs you might have noticed lately, our content (reels, podcasts) has become much darker. It's much more inclined toward the paranormal now... That is because I'm personally exploring these subjects in depth. Have they taken over me completely? Not yet. But I am definitely altered by the things I am learning about.\n\nThe one thing I know for sure is that ghosts, monsters, torture, darkness, and everything in between... They're all modes of some sort of (dark) self-discovery.\n\nIn this episode, we speak about the life of a paranormal investigator, his scariest experience, ghosts that attack objects, meditations that can settle in the effects of the paranormal, and more. Stay tuned for a sequel episode with Sarbajeet Mohanty on TRS very soon.\n\n#paranormal #1816 \n\nINSTAGRAM : @beerbiceps \nhttps://www.instagram.com/beerbiceps/ \n\nFACEBOOK : @beerbiceps \nhttps://www.facebook.com/beerbiceps/ \n\nTWITTER : @beerbicepsguy\nhttps://twitter.com/BeerBicepsGuy\n\nLINKEDIN : @beerbiceps\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/BeerBiceps\n\nTELEGRAM: @beerbicepsguy\nhttps://t.me/beerbicepsguy\n\nSNAPCHAT: @beerbicepsguy\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAbout :\nTRS Clips is a collection of SHORT CLIPS from The Ranveer Show podcast.

        "description": "What would you do if you found a mummified hand hidden away in your closet or treasures you've never even dreamed of ever finding\n\nSubscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr\n\n5. Consolacion Shipwreck\nPirates wreaked so much havoc in on the seas, they could actually make their enemies sink their own boats. In August of 1680 a ship called the Consolacion sunk off the coast of Ecuador. The galleon was encountered by a group of English pirates, after it had picked up a large amount of gold from Lima, Peru. Before Pirates could get their hands on some of the treasures they were seeking the Spanish, set the ship on fire. They‚Äôd rather have the boat at the bottom of the sea then hand it over. A crew of explorer eventually salvaged the wreck in 1997 near the Santa Clara Island of Ecuador. Large amounts of gold and silver coins were uncovered and are even on sale online. \n\n4. Montego Bay Pirate Treasure\nMontego Bay located on the island of Jamaica is an infamous place where pirates commonly lurked so it made for an excellent location to search for pirate treasures! A group of American treasure hunters set sail in the jamaican waters hoping to snatch some booty. The 17th century English vessel named the Manticore, was badly damaged and found in international waters just outside the Jamaican border limit. One of the scuba swimmers, Rick Miller, describes it as being an amazing experience, with gold and silver everywhere! Treasure‚Äôs one could only dream of! Just the weight of the precious metals alone is worth 187 million dollars. \n\n3. Black Beard‚Äôs Ship in North Carolina\n In 1966, a an important piece of history was brought to the surface with the help from underwater divers off the coast of Beaufort, North Carolina. The vessel of, Queen Anne‚Äôs Revenge finally saw the light of day once again. This time, the boat came from Blackbeard himself and it is a true miracle this artifact from the past was brought to surface. They came across the heavy cannons, some weighing 2000 pounds each. 30 cannons were found total. Each cannonball that was fired, weighed at least 6 pounds. More than 280,000 rare historical facts were found. This pirate met Davy Jones locker in a gruesome fashion. British soldiers displayed is severed head on the ship where he was executed as a warning to pirates. That‚Äôs just a pirate‚Äôs life for you. This replica is what it possibly would have looked like at full strength and would have struck fear in any sailors heart! His flag was also gruesome.\n\n2. Pirates Hand\nWhile doing a little bit of cleaning, a Florida couple in Tampa Bay were going through their attic when they came across a startling discovery. In the attic was a wooden box with a treasure map. Spanish coins and the strangest of all; a severed hand with a ring on it! Could these be some artifacts left from the legendary Jose Gaspar, a legendary Spanish pirate who would sail off the west coast of Florida, although it‚Äôs still a mystery of whether he even existed at all. Before you start jumping to conclusions, the authenticity is hard to prove. Pirates weren‚Äôt too well-known for openly documenting their every move. The Tampa Bay History curator, told WFLA news that he believed the coins are too thin to be authentic. And who knows if that hand thing is even real?! Is this finding a morbid hoax or possibly an unbelievable pirate hoax?\n\n1. The Whydah Discovery\nThe Whydah was a British slave ship that was originally captured by ‚ÄúBlack Sam‚Äù and was found off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts in 1984 by Barry Clifford. He actually credits a pirate treasure map that many discredited as being false. It seems to be the holy grail of pirate discoveries! Priceless artifacts  were discovered including 200,000 individual pieces were received under only 14 feet of water. Rare gold and silver coins, gold jewelry and artifacts, cannons, sword handles and even a boy‚Äôs leg! The boat is believed to carry the plunder of 10 ships. Spanish Galleons were relentless looted by Black Sam until him and his crew were swept away by a strong storm in 1717. Divers pulled together huge clumps of gold coin masses that stuck together from years of being underwater. A museum exhibition called ‚ÄúReal Pirates: The Untold Story of the Whydah, from Slave Ship to Pirate Ship‚Äù, toured the United States. Barry believes there is more treasure out there from this wreck."

For example, its believed the Japanese pirate Yamada Nagamasa buried his enormous loot on Magnetic Island. It is rumored to be worth $100 million, and has never been found. Ben finds a strange symbol carved in a prominent rock on Magnetic Island, opposite the only bay a ship could safely anchor in. Is this symbol the proverbial x marking the spot?\n\nSo what became of all the gold and silver that fate often cruelly snatched from its rightful owners? Some were recovered, some lost forever, but much still remains for the intrepid treasure hunter who is prepared to research the facts, sift through the legends, and give it a try.\n\nBen's film will take us around Australia to where these sunken treasures lie.\n\n It's like Netflix for history...

Top predators like the american alligators prey regularly on all kinds of reptiles, including pythons. An adult alligator will have little trouble to overpower, kill and eat any juvenile and in some cases even an adult constrictor. \n\nA fully grown Burmese Python can reach over twenty feet in lengths and becomes extremely dangerous prey item for most crocodilians. These large constrictors have not much to fear and will feed on most animals they come across (including alligators) when hungry. Pythons are non venomous snakes and kill by constricting their prey, wrapping its body around in a thigh coil until the animals dies of suffocation within a few minuets. The prey will be swallowed mostly head first and whole. This process can take considerable time  during which the snake is vulnerable to attacks from other predators. Confrontations between pythons and alligator have been recorded during the last years but still, very little is know on the outcome of such ‚Äúfights‚Äù. The fact is that invasive species like the burmese pythons are a part of the Everglades today and it is up to everyone to find out as much as possible and use the newly gain knowledge to keep the python population in check. Alligator attacks python filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro near the Everglades in 2013."

This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. \n\nWe start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.\n\nThis is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.\n\nTo me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species. \n\nFeaturing the voices of David Attenborough, Craig Childs, Brian Cox, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michelle Thaller, Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, Mike Rowe, Phil Plait, Janna Levin, Stephen Hawking, Sean Carroll, Alex Filippenko, and Martin Rees.\n\nBig thanks to Protocol Labs for their support of this creation: https://protocol.ai/ \n\nAnd to my Patreon supporters: Juan Benet, Kalexan, Laine Boswell, Holly, Dave & Debbie Boswell, Abraxas, Alina Sigaeva, Aksel Tj√∏nn, Daniel Saltzman, Crystal, Eico Neumann, geekiskhan, Giulia Carrozzino, Hannah Murphy, Jeremy Kerwin, JousterL, Lars St√∏ttrup Nielsen, Leonard van Vliet, Mitchel Mattera, Nathan Paskett, Patrick Cullen, Randall Bollig, Roman Shishkin, Silas Rech, Stefan Stettner, The Cleaner, Timothy E Plum, Virtual_271, Westin Johnson, Yannic, and Anna & Tyson.\n\nSoundtrack now available: https://bit.ly/2HKl9fi and coming soon to iTunes/Spotify/Etc\n\nPeace and love,\n\nmelodysheep\n@musicalscience\nmelodysheep.com\n\nConcept, music, writing, edit, and visual effects by melodysheep, with additional visual material sourced from:\n\nNASA Goddard\nGoogle\nSpaceX\n2012\nGeostorm\nInto the Universe with Stephen Hawking\nBMW X1 \nJourney to the Edge of the Universe\nNoah\nHow the Universe Works\nDeep Impact\nWonders of the Universe\nMoon raker vfx reel\nVoyage of Time\n\nif you found the text hard to read, check out the large text version:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQpfueZkJ-4\n\nVoice sample sources:\n\nAttenborough Davos Speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuudPum21nE\nCraig Childs - Long Now Talk http://longnow.org/seminars/02013/jul/29/apocalyptic-planet-field-guide-everending-earth/\nBrian Cox - Wonders of the Universe Episode 1 \nNeil deGrasse Tyson interview with Bill Moyers https://vimeo.com/84075447\nHow the Universe Works - Season 3 Episode 2 \nWill The Universe Ever End with Lawrence Krauss https://www.closertotruth.com/series/will-the-universe-ever-end#video-2549\nJanna Levin TED Talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLz9TvxGoKs\nA Brief History of Time (1991) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAfxKExKjVQ\nWhat Happens in the Far Far Future https://www.closertotruth.com/series/what-happens-the-far-far-future\nSean Carroll TEDxCaltech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaTyg8wR4Y\nAlex Filippenko - TEDxSF https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gAtPyEu0G4\nTo Infinity and Beyond: The Accelerating Universe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKdA2-W0X0\nMartin Rees interview http://www.closertotruth.com/series/what-happens-the-far-far-future#video-3625\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/oIuX/"

        "description": "FAQ: https://randomphotons.com/alone \n\nImages: http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/\nMusic: 'Freedom Fighters' by Two Steps from Hell\n\nEditor: David Peterson\nServing Suggestion: 1080p, lights off, volume up :)\n\nInspired by a version of the opening sequence of this clip called 'What does it feel like to fly over planet Earth?' (Inspiration: http://youtu.be/74mhQyuyELQ), I tracked down the original time-lapse sequence taken on the International Space Station (ISS) via NASA, found some additional ones there, including the spectacular Aurora Australis sequences, and set it to a soundtrack that almost matches the awe and wonder I feel when I see our home from above. \n\nTo those brave men and women who fly alone in the night to take us to the stars, we salute you.\n\n-----------------------\n\nSequences:\n\n0:00 North-to-south down the western coast of North and South America.\n0:48 North-to-south over Florida, the Bahamas and other Caribbean islands.\n0:56 South-East Asia, approaching the Philippine Sea\n1:04 Western Europe, from France through Italy, Greece, Turkey and the Middle East.\n1:20 Aurora Australis, over the Indian Ocean, approaching Australia\n1:36 Aurora Australis, over the Indian Ocean.\n1:52 Aurora Australis, unknown location in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n-----------------------\n\nFeatured on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day!\nhttp://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120305.html\n\nExplanation from NASA: Many wonders are visible when flying over the Earth at night. A compilation of such visual spectacles was captured recently from the International Space Station (ISS) and set to rousing music. Passing below are white clouds, orange city lights, lightning flashes in thunderstorms, and dark blue seas. On the horizon is the golden haze of Earth's thin atmosphere, frequently decorated by dancing auroras as the video progresses. The green parts of auroras typically remain below the space station, but the station flies right through the red and purple auroral peaks. Solar panels of the ISS are seen around the frame edges. The ominous wave of approaching brightness at the end of each sequence is just the dawn of the sunlit half of Earth, a dawn that occurs every 90 minutes."

        "description": "This 1 minute time-lapse video captures the 48 hour blizzard of winter storm Jonas that hit the east coast of the United States between January 22 and 24, 2016.  The camera was set up on our front porch in northern Virginia, USA, and captured 1 frame every 30 seconds.  I further compressed it down to 1 frame every 90 seconds to produce this video which culminates with the beautiful sunrise on Sunday morning.  You can even see Venus rising in the east just before sunrise.  The final measurement on the yardstick was 31 inches or 79 centimeters.  It is very interesting to see how the snow compresses somewhat right before sunrise.\n\nBy popular demand, here is a 3 1/2 minute version of the same custom synthesized music soundtrack \"Wonder and Awe\" that was used in this video.  https://youtu.be/kOtQ6gXof00\n\nA short clip from this video was featured on Al Roker's new show, Weather Hacks, which premiered on The Weather Channel (TWC) on Sunday, February 12, 2017 at 10 pm EST.\n\nThis copyrighted video may not be duplicated, reproduced, or retransmitted in any form without the expressed written consent by the original content producer."

Audio has been softened for the faint of heart. Miraculously, no lives were lost from this tornado despite immense damage and nearly 1,000 structures impacted. This shows how incredible the tornado warning process was for this storm. We called in the tornado in progress and NWS issued a tornado warning and sirens sounded. We hope that this drone footage can advance our understanding of the tornado relationship with the ground and the influence of friction. \n\nFOLLOW me on your favorite platforms & CONTACT me here:\nhttps://linktr.ee/reedtimmer\n\n#extremeweather\n#kansas\n#tornado\n#perspective\n#tornadoes\n#storm\n#stormchase\n#stormchasing\n#dronefootage\n#meteorology \n#reedtimmer \n\n4/29/2022"

        "description": "Documentary about Tornado Alley weather in 2018.  The best of tornadoes, landspout tornadoes, lightning and spectacular storms caught on camera from South Texas to South Dakota including behind the scenes wildlife & wackiness. \n\n***NOT FOR REBROADCAST***\nCOPYRIGHT PECOS HANK LLC. \nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nFor licensing video contact hankschyma@gmail.com\n\n2018 Tornado Statistics:  \n\nIt seemed the theme for 2018 was gnarly, tornado warned storms, reluctant to drop tornadoes.  It was a less active year with 991 confirmed tornadoes reported in the US. That's more than 200 less than the annual average of around 1250.  \n\nWith only 10 reported deaths, 2018 also had the lowest number of tornado-related fatalities on record in the United States.  This is the lowest amount since records began in 1875.\n\n2018 also reported an absence of incredibly violent tornadoes. This is the first year since records began in 1950 that a F/ EF4 or F/ EF5 tornado was not rated anywhere in the U.S.\n*One EF4 was rated in Canada on August 3rd near Alonsa Manitoba.\n\nDespite a lackluster year for tornado aficionados, there was no shortage of beautiful storm structures and epic lightning.  In fact, 2018 is my best year ever for lightning captures since beginning around 1995.  One of the highlights of the year was in the AM hours of June 25th.  I followed an MCS across Kansas and captured several clusters of multiple leaders leaping up from wind turbines into the clouds.  Also know as upward-moving lightning or ground-to-cloud lightning, these upward moving clusters numbered from 6 to 14 leaders upward moving leaders at a time.  The discharges appear simultaneous on high speed video with a frame rate of 240 / second, however higher speed video might eventually reveal separations in these clustered discharges. \n\nStorm Facts & Information:\n\nPOSITIVE & NEGATIVE LIGHTNING\nHow can you tell the difference between positive and negative lightning?  \n\nPositive lightning typically originates higher in the storm and flash durations tend to exist longer than less powerful negative strikes. Negative lightning flashes tend to be quicker and with multiple flickers or strokes.  This is a good basis for distinguishing the two, however not fool proof. \n\nLANDSPOUT TORNADOES\nIs a landspout a tornado? What is the difference? \n\nYes, landspouts are tornadoes. Landspouts are like waterspouts but form over land.  These tornadoes do not develop from supercell mesocyclones, rather low level vorticity colocated under a stretching storm updraft.  They tend to be weaker (on the EF0 to EF1 range) but can still pack all the beauty.   \n\n\nStorm Video, photography and editing by Pecos Hank LLC.

        "description": "From spider lightning to bolts shooting out of tornadoes.  Here are my best lightning strikes caught on camera over the last 20 years.  For licensing contact hankschyma@yahoo.com\n\nMore info and facts:\n\n#10 Was caught in 2014 on a Kansas interstate. In slo-mo you can see the distant discharge triggering the closer strike. \n\n#9  was bagged under a tornadic supercell near Lincoln Nebraska.  What makes this bolt so striking was it's bizarre looping path.\n\n#8 Occurred on May 31, 2013 near El Reno Oklahoma.  This historic and horrifying day saw the birth of the world's largest tornado at 2.6 miles wide... And the fact that there's a bolt of lightning shooting out of it's massive infant side makes this strike worthy of this list.  \n\n#7 was summoned over Devils Tower in Wyoming in June of 2013.  \n\nAnvil Crawler lightning also called \"Spider Lightning\" due to the way it scampers across the sky is one of nature's most dramatic displays. I've photographed hundreds of anvil crawler webs, but only once lurking over a paralyzed 1956 Mercury Monterrey. That's why this lightning strike is #6.   \n\n# 5, 4 & 3 all come from one intense evening.  In June of 2010,  a violent storm in North Texas was bombarding the Earth with constant bolts of negative and positive lightning... When the strikes are slowed down you can really see individual flashes that make the lightning flicker.  It's an incredible super long mega bolt and it's 14 separate flashes that scores number 5 on my favorites. \n\n*****CORRECTION: Positive flashes are usually composed of a single stroke, whereas about 80% of negative flashes contain two or more strokes (e.g., Rakov et al. (1994). Multiple-stroke positive flashes do occur but they are relatively rare. Heidler et al. (1998), from electric field measurements in 1995‚Äì97 in Germany, found that out of a total of 36 positive flashes, 32 contained one stroke and 4 contained two strokes. On the other hand, Lyons et al. (1998b), using NLDN data for 14 selected summer months from 1991 to 1995, reported on 1002 positive flashes (about 0.04% of a total of 2.7 million positive flashes) composed of more than 10 strokes. However, in the author‚Äôs view, it is likely that some of these multiple-stroke events are actually misidentified cloud discharges.*****  \n\nPositive lightning is the most deadly of the bolts. They can leap from the tops of thunderstorms out to the ground up to 10 miles away. To complete this stealthy journey they can generate a billion volts... PLUS When these Daddies fire, they can heat the air to over 54,000 degrees F (30,000 C). That's over 5 times hotter than the surface of the Sun which is about 10,000 F.  \n\nBecause of their tendency to leap away from rain and low storm clouds, positive lightning is extra photogenic.\n\n#2 was a crazy perfectly framed anvil crawler discharge crashing to Earth between Brady and Fredricksburg TX in 2013.  \n\n#1 was caught on camera on June 16th, 2014 in Northeast Nebraska.  2 tornadoes are on the ground as lightning strikes."

These man-made caves are approximately 2,200 years old and have puzzled historians and archaeologists since their discovery. Despite extensive research, the civilization responsible for carving out these intricate China caves remain unknown. The Longyou Caves feature large underground rooms, with walls, ceilings, and pillars carved with great precision. This video delves into various theories and historical contexts to shed light on this mysterious site.\n\nThis underground labyrinth of interconnected tunnels. Somehow they managed to excavate over 1 million cubic meters of rock, with apparently no tools or advanced technology.\n\nHow was this possible?\n\nWhat deepens this Ancient Mystery are the rock carvings, they're so accurate and intricate that they are extremely advanced for the time.\n\n#ancientmysteries #ancientcivilizations #ancienttechnology"

But real-life caveman Angelo Mastropietro has made his hermit dream a reality - by spending over ¬£160,000 turning a 700-year-old cave, carved into 250 million year old sandstone cliffs in the the Wyre Forest, into his dream home. The 38-year-old, originally from Worcestershire, was living a high-flying life as the head of a successful recruitment company in Australia when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2007. The condition led to him being temporarily paralysed - and inspired him to seek a simpler life. \n\nFor more information on the Rockhouse, including rental queries, visit http://www.therockhouseretreat.co.uk\n\nVideographer / Director: Jon Dean\nProducer: Tom Midlane, Nick Johnson\nEditor: Kyle Waters\n\n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\nBear Grylls Adventure: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzcUNwS7mypzPhW4gsjO7og/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit BARCROFT.TV: http://www.barcroft.tv/\nLike BARCROFT TV on Facebook: https://www.Facebook.com/BarcroftTV\nFollow @Barcroft_TV on Twitter: https://www.Twitter.com/Barcroft_TV\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/videos"

From the Moon, our closest cosmic neighbor, to the edges of the observable universe, prepare to be astonished by the sheer scale of everything that exists.\n\nTravel with us as we venture past the Moon, understanding its distance in terms we can grasp. Witness the Sun, not just as a source of light, but as a milestone in the vastness of our solar system. We don't stop there; Mars, Neptune, and the outer reaches of our solar neighborhood await.\n\nDiscover the awe-inspiring distances to the Voyager 1 probe, the enigmatic Oort Cloud, and the neighboring star system of Alpha Centauri. As we sail through the Milky Way, understand our position in the grand scheme of things, where our entire history is just a whisper in the cosmic wind.\n\nOur voyage takes us further, to the Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, and the staggering Laniakea Supercluster. We contemplate the Great Attractor's pull and our place in this immense heaven.\n\nConfront the boundaries of the observable universe and ponder the mystery of what lies beyond. This video is not just a journey through space but a journey of perspective. Join us in marveling at the universe's grandeur and our humble place within it.\n\nSubscribe to Science Time: https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\n\n#universe #sciencetime #space"

A combination of various factors has turned some of them into mysterious anomalies, exceptional even by space standards.\n\nSome of these objects are amazing exoplanets, strikingly similar to Earth, while others have never seen sunlight or experienced heat. There are worlds torn by continuous sandstorms, while others are covered by a vast ocean whose bottom is made of blocks of glowing ice. At the same time, in the depths of multicoloured nebulae there are giant stars capable of swallowing whole planetary systems, and millions of light years away from them jellyfish galaxies cut through the expanses of space with their shining stellar tentacles.\n\nAnd today, we invite you to join us on a fantastic journey to the most incredible ones.\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:13 Teegarden b\n10:52 The Most Anomalous Planets\n26:44 Rogue Planets\n37:15 James Webb (other worlds)\n51:26 TOI-700 d\n1:01:10 Horrifying Planets\n1:13:12 Gliese 1214 b (ocean planet)\n1:22:20 The Orion Nebula\n1:36:37 Scary Planets\n1:48:54 CW Leonis (a dying giant)\n1:58:54 WR 102 (the hottest star)\n2:09:29 Stephenson 2-18 (the biggest star)\n2:17:31 The Milky Way\n2:32:17 The Weirdest Galaxies\n2:40:40 A Journey to the Edge of the Universe\n2:52:15 What Will Happen when the Universe Is No More?\n3:04:32 Ending\n\n#Universe #Anomalies #Planets #Space #Cosmos #Film #kosmo"

Their search for ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äù lasted more than a century, but only resulted in disaster, death, and further conquest of the indigenous people there. \n\nExperts thereafter looked at the Amazon and saw only a desolate jungle; too harsh for extensive agriculture and therefore sparsely populated. They believed that it had always been this way. \n\nUntil recently. \n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, archaeologists began looking more closely at the forest floor. Working with the indigenous people who still remained there, they excavated long ditches and mounds. After mapping them, they could see that these were the markings of large settlements; walls, moats, plazas, and roads that connected even more settlements. And they were all over the Amazon. \n\nFurther reading: \n\nThe Lost City of Z, David Grann\nExploration Fawcett: Journey to the Lost City of Z, Percy Fawcett\n\nThe works of Michael Heckenberger; https://anthro.ufl.edu/2013/09/29/heckenberger/\n\nLidar reveals pre-Hispanic low-density urbanism in the Bolivian Amazon https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04780-4\n\nThe geoglyph sites of Acre, Brazil: 10 000-year-old land-use practices and climate change in Amazonia https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/geoglyph-sites-of-acre-brazil-10-000yearold-landuse-practices-and-climate-change-in-amazonia/6E74670EB776FB3DE3EE426A87847C33\n\nPredicting pre-Columbian anthropogenic soils in Amazonia https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2475\n\nThe Lore of Lost Cities - Imagining The Lost City Of Z https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidanderson/2019/04/30/the-lore-of-lost-cities-imagining-the-lost-city-of-z/?sh=2114a4fc4862\n\nOnce Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon‚Äôs Lost World\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

All recordings of this Thunderstorm were made this year in the south west of Germany, namely in the Black Forest. I stayed in this area for quite some time and had the chance to do some decent recordings. I know that most of you love the Dark Screen series, therefore I didn't include any complex animations with the sounds, just pure nature noise. \nIf you have any questions regarding the recordings or if you have feedback in general then please feel free to drop me a comment in the section below. Likes and Subs are also always welcome, so you don't miss any future uploads. \n\nKeep in mind that these black screen thunderstorm sleep sounds may also work for meditation, yoga or if you want to erase annoying surrounding sounds. So it could be a perfect composition if you want to study. You may also try it, if you suffer from Tinnitus, Insomnia or other sleeping disorders. \n\nüí´ I recommend listening to the video at low volume, so you have the best relaxing feeling.

These natural phenomena have the power to lead us into a world of inner calm, where we can find peace, meditate, learn, and conquer our fears and sleep disturbances. Join us as we immerse ourselves in the soothing symphony of rain and thunder, discovering the transformative power of these divine sounds.\n\nüîä To enjoy the best audio quality, adjust the volume to your preference and use high-quality headphones or speakers.\n\nüîÇ Did you know? Thanks to YouTube's innovative features, you can repeat this video as many times as your heart desires.\n\nRain and thunder often carry a somber aura. To match the theme, I present a four-hour forest ambiance in black and white. Even if you struggle with insomnia or have difficulty falling asleep, this can be an extremely valuable resource. People use the calming sounds of nature in various ways - be it for relaxation, improving their sleep, or simply seeking solace for their soul. These natural melodies have the power to alleviate stress and soothe anxieties. Some even incorporate them into their study sessions or meditation practices. They have the versatility to be used in all these scenarios, but their primary purpose is to help you break free from fears and stress and find a peaceful and refreshing sleep.\n\n12 HOUR VERSION WITH BLACKSCREEN\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7MsQJXlqRg\n\nIf you have found value and joy in my work, please don't forget to subscribe to my channel and connect with me on social media!\n\nYouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/NatureSFX?sub_confirmation=1\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/naturesfx_\n\nConsider becoming a channel member to receive exclusive benefits:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfsZsMaDMDpN-1lYeWnteMg/join\n\nTags: #RainSounds #Thunderstorm #Sleep #WaterSounds #Relax #Meditate #Learn #Rain #FallAsleep #Sleeping #DeepSleep #ASMR #Tinnitus #Anxiety #AntiStress #Relaxation\n\nCopyright @ [Nature SFX, 2023]\nAny unauthorized reproduction of these contents will be pursued legally."

The genre arose in the mid-1970s in the United States, but it was not named \"smooth jazz\" until the 1980s. Traditional jazz players and jazz purists did not embrace the popular style; Jazz Journal's \"Sound Investment\" column stated in November 1999 that it \"would cover an extremely wide spectrum of jazz styles\" while avoiding smooth jazz.\n\nThe earliest smooth jazz music appearing in the 1970s includes the 1975 album Touch by saxophonist John Klemmer, the song \"Breezin'\" as performed by guitarist George Benson in 1976, the 1977 instrumental composition \"Feels So Good\" by flugelhorn player Chuck Mangione, and jazz fusion group Spyro Gyra's instrumental \"Morning Dance\", released in 1979. Smooth jazz grew in popularity in the 1980s as Anita Baker, Sade, Al Jarreau and Grover Washington released multiple hit songs. The smooth jazz genre began to decline at the end of the 1980s in a backlash exemplified by critical complaints about what many critics saw as the \"bland\" sound of top-selling saxophonist Kenny G, whose popularity peaked with his 1992 album Breathless.\" ~Wikipedia\n\n..................................\n\nDr. SaxLove specializes in soft smooth instrumental music.  A blend of Motown and Pop cover songs.  I great chillout lounge vibe to relax.  His music is optimized for relaxation, studying, dinner music, sensual moments, or any time chill out saxophone music is desired.\n\nReuse of audio/video not permitted. ¬©Ô∏è2021 by SaxLove Productions, Inc\n\n#smoothjazz \n#jazzmusic \n#chilloutmusic \n#jazzsaxophone \n#softjazz \n#relaxingmusic \n#jazz"

Generally, smooth jazz relies on rhythms and grooves instead of improvisation. There are layers of synthesizers, lite-funk rhythms, lite-funk bass, elastic guitars, and either trumpets, alto, or soprano saxophones.\"\n\nurbandictionary.com says:\n\"The kind of music played on The Weather Channel.\"\nand\n\"A niche form of pop music that is appreciated by people who don't like jazz. They think it sounds cool to be a smooth jazz listener and don't realize that it's not jazz at all. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the difference between jazz and smooth jazz is like the diffference between lightning and a lightning bug.\"\nand\n\"A musical genre characterized by bland instrumental watered-down jazz; the soundtrack for men in between mid-life-crisises. Every city has a radio station devoted to this brand of ambient droning -- usually called 'The Oasis.' \" (I especially like that one.)\n\nAnd Wikipedia says:\n\"Smooth jazz is a commercially oriented, crossover jazz which came to prominence in the 1980s, displacing the more venturesome jazz fusion from which it emerged. It avoids the improvisational \"risk-taking\" of jazz fusion, emphasizing melodic form. Much of the music was initially \"a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&B\" \"\n\nIf it's smooth and it's jazzy? It's Smooth Jazz. So say I, the Dr. \n~Dr. SaxLove\n\n..................................\r\n\r\nDr. SaxLove specializes in smooth jazz, jazz music, smooth jazz instrumental, soft jazz, Motown jazz, jazz blues, jazz saxophone, and saxophone jazz.

The genre arose in the mid-1970s in the United States, but it was not named \"smooth jazz\" until the 1980s. Traditional jazz players and jazz purists did not embrace the popular style; Jazz Journal's \"Sound Investment\" column stated in November 1999 that it \"would cover an extremely wide spectrum of jazz styles\" while avoiding smooth jazz.\n\nThe earliest smooth jazz music appearing in the 1970s includes the 1975 album Touch by saxophonist John Klemmer, the song \"Breezin'\" as performed by guitarist George Benson in 1976, the 1977 instrumental composition \"Feels So Good\" by flugelhorn player Chuck Mangione, and jazz fusion group Spyro Gyra's instrumental \"Morning Dance\", released in 1979. Smooth jazz grew in popularity in the 1980s as Anita Baker, Sade, Al Jarreau and Grover Washington released multiple hit songs. The smooth jazz genre began to decline at the end of the 1980s in a backlash exemplified by critical complaints about what many critics saw as the \"bland\" sound of top-selling saxophonist Kenny G, whose popularity peaked with his 1992 album Breathless.\" ~Wikipedia\n\n..................................\n\nDr. SaxLove specializes in soft smooth instrumental music.  A blend of Motown and Pop cover songs.  I great chillout lounge vibe to relax.  His music is optimized for relaxation, studying, dinner music, sensual moments, or any time chill out saxophone music is desired.\n\nReuse of audio/video not permitted. ¬©Ô∏è2021 by SaxLove Productions, Inc\n\n#smoothjazz \n#jazzmusic \n#chilloutmusic \n#jazzsaxophone \n#softjazz \n#relaxingmusic \n#jazz"

You do not have to point it out in the comments over and over again. Secondly, I mainly created this mix for the gym and working out, but you can use it for whatever you want. I did not create any of these speeches or music, I just put it all together. Some of the speakers consist of: Eric Thomas, Elliot Hulse, Will smith, Les Brown, Rocky, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and others. I do not know a lot of the song names or the exact title of a lot of the speeches. I made this mix in a time span of a couple weeks and never kept track of the titles and such. I am sorry for that. There are some repeated speech tidbits, but its not a big deal. I just hope I can get some of you motivated. Enjoy.\n\nListen to it on SoundCloud- https://soundcloud.com/woundedduck/hour-long-motivational-mix\n\nSubscribe- http://full.sc/Zf3O1w\nLike me on facebook- http://full.sc/ZIhzS4\nAdd me on facebook- http://full.sc/VSL9pA\nFollow me on twitter- http://full.sc/VSLfh2"

We decided to do that by associating drawings from the major painters that were following the scientific findings of this research. \nThe choice of these paintings and the consecutive association with the music is also based on an accurate work that requires significant time and energy.\n\nThe analysis of the melodies returned to us a lot of information on how the painting should have been made. We needed a simple blue pattern but with an intrinsic meaning. Something that people could watch for a while without really understand it.\n\nBy creating this video I tried to do only one thing which turned to be the most difficult one: make you feel an emotional synesthesia. \nWhen hearing the melody, don't you feel that everything is...blue? aren‚Äôt you lost in the sky? is your mind going over? It‚Äôs not for no reason.\nit is not only an image, it is not only a melody. It is a trip. \nYou don't feel bored. Its your mind using the notes and the colors to create your own experience.\n\nMost of the videos online with only one image are only music, but not this. \n\nThe research behind the perfect combination is the key for the unconscious.\n\nThe research:\n\"Music‚Äìcolor associations are mediated by emotion\"\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/110/22/8836\nStephen E.

Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: \"Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\".\n\nThank you so much for watching this video by Halidon Music channel, we hope you enjoyed it!

These songs are extremely nostalgic and bring out various feelings, especially with the touch of Lo-fi in them. I hope you like it, I worked hard to choose the best songs, made by Lo-fi producers (credits in the video and in the description), to create a very pleasant vibe for all of you! :)\n\nüìù About the \"Lo-fi Music\" channel:\nMy purpose here is to spread good Lo- fi Hiphop artists and producers to the whole world, through compilations, in which I carefully and slowly choose the best songs to put on it. The result of this work are videos that really bring feelings to people and make them meet new Lo-fi artists. More than just showing artists, I want to create a community of lovers and producers of the Lo-fi genre. Making all this happen ‚Äì sharing artists, creating a community and helping people ‚Äì is what moves me to continue bringing this content to the world.\n\nüé∂ Tracklist:\n\n[00:00] Can't Take My Eyes Off You (Aiivawn Lofi Remix)\nCredits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmQjdvSH5qk\n\n[04:00] Just want to be the one you love by cryst\nCredits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLQEdhCoBE4\n\n[05:58] Fly Me To The Moon - Joytastic Sarah (Prod.

        "description": "\"Feeling Good\" (also known as \"Feelin' Good\") is a song written by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse for the 1964 musical \"The Roar Of The Greasepaint‚ÄîThe Smell Of The Crowd\" and has since been recorded by many artists, including Muse, Sammy Davis Jr., Bobby Darin, Traffic, Michael Bubl√©, The Pussycat Dolls, George Michael, John Barrowman, John Coltrane, To≈°e Proeski, Frank Sinatra Jr., and Adam Lambert.  Perhaps the most famous version was recorded by Nina Simone, and first appeared on her 1965 album \"I Put A Spell On You\".  Simone's version is also featured in the 1993 film \"Point Of No Return\", in which the protagonist uses the code name 'Nina' and professes to be a longtime fan of Simone's music.  At least half the soundtrack for the film featured Nina Simone songs.  The song was also featured in the promotional video of the TV series \"Six Feet Under\" (4th season), and is included in the show's volume 2 soundtrack.  Additionally, Simone's version is also included in the 2006 film, \"Last Holiday\", in the 2010 film \"Repo Men\", appears as a background track in the 2009 game \"The Saboteur\" (despite the game taking place in Nazi-occupied Paris, long before the song was made), and is featured in the television series \"Chuck\" during the third season episode \"Chuck Versus The Honeymooners\".  Eunice Kathleen Waymon (February 21, 1933 -- April 21, 2003), better known by her stage name Nina Simone, was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and civil rights activist.  Although she disliked being categorized, Simone is most associated with jazz music.  Simone originally aspired to become a classical pianist, but her recorded work covers an eclectic variety of musical styles that include classical, jazz, blues, soul, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.  Her vocal style is characterized by intense passion, a loose vibrato, and a slightly androgynous timbre, in part due to her unusually low vocal range which veered between the alto and tenor ranges, occasionally even reaching baritone lows.  Also known as 'The High Priestess Of Soul', she paid great attention to the musical expression of emotions.  Within one album or concert she could fluctuate between exuberant happiness and tragic melancholy.  These fluctuations also characterized her own personality and personal life, amplified by bipolar disorder with which she was diagnosed in the mid-1960s, something not widely known until after her death in 2003, though she wrote of it openly in her autobiography published in 1992.  According to Nadine Cohodas, Simone's biographer, Ms. Simone was first diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and later with schizophrenia. Simone recorded over 40 live and studio albums, the greatest body of her work released between 1958, when she made her debut with \"Little Girl Blue\", and 1974.  Her music and message made a strong and lasting impact on musical culture, illustrated by the numerous contemporary artists who cite her as an important influence.  Several hip-hop musicians and other modern artists sample and remix Simone's rhythms and beats on their tracks.  Many of her songs are featured on motion picture soundtracks, as well as in video games, commercials, and TV series.  This channel is dedicated to the classic jazz music you've loved for years.

        "description": "When she discovers a pearl in the belly of a fish, a Konkani fisherwoman resigned to a mundane life of daily struggle, abandons her trade and indulges in her wildest fantasy. She buys herself a brightly colored rickshaw (‚Äútuk tuk‚Äù) and starts to cruise at lightning speed through the winding roads of her coastal village, with her cats in tow. Finally released from her daily drudgery, ecstatic at her newly found sense of power and freedom, she is the talk of the town and her own greatest hero, when, suddenly, an accident threatens to thwart her indomitable spirit.\n\n An exuberant, wild and joyous tale about a woman‚Äôs awakening of dormant desires, that celebrates the thrill of adventure and the triumph of dreaming big and pursuing even our most wacky, psychedelic fantasies against all odds. Soulfully told in loud color and trippy animation, the film has won India‚Äôs National Award for Animation\n\n (- Indian Film Festival Los Angeles, 2018)\n\nIt seems like all of Suresh‚Äôs stories come from the Mumbai streetscape. The brash and burly fisherwoman that squeezed through the mad traffic jam in Worli, to get to the other side of the road, happened to walk in front of Suresh, who was already frustrated by the delay to get to a client meeting. As the narrow gap between Suresh‚Äôs car and the huge BEST bus in the front( yes, that‚Äôs what Mumbai‚Äôs bus service is called!) was too little for her to pass through, she got irritated at him for being so close to the bus. Showering him with abuses with precious animated gestures for parking so close, she gathered enough momentum to squeeze through that patch.. Eriyat, both rattled and dumbfounded, sat back and wondered if there was any possible comeback to her aggression. He wondered how effortlessly she meted out such choicest cuss words which he considered solely as a man‚Äôs license a few minutes before! She kept looking back at him to check if he dared to get back at her. But she didn‚Äôt know that he had already made a mental sketch of her. By the time he reached his studio, he had a storyline and character sketch ready!\n\nCredits : \n\nStory and Direction : Suresh Eriyat\nProducer : Nilima Eriyat\nMusic : Rajat Dholakia\nSound Design : Shalini Agarwal\nTheme Song : Chetan Sashital\nSound Re-Recording Mixer : Subir Das\nAll Voices\n(Conceived, Designed and performed ) : Chetan Sashital\nProject lead : Nikhil Joshi , Abhijit Budge\nStying and Design : Suresh Eriyat, Nikhil Joshi\nPre-production Design :Nikhil Joshi, Nivedita Goswami, Hitendra Singh, Shraddhha Matkar, Khayali Pandya\nCharacter Modeling : Nikhil Joshi, Nivedita Goswami, Amar Patel, Keyur Patel, Khayali Pandaya , Aditya Raje\nBackground Modeling : Amar Patel, Keyur Patel, Aditya Raje\n3D Animation team : Anjelo David, Abhijit Budge, Swapnil Patil, Anik Roy, Debajyoti Roychowdhury\nRigging : Hitendra Singh , Anik Roy\nProp  Modeling : Nikhil Joshi, Nivedita Goswami, Amar Patel , Keyur Patel , Khayali Pandya, Aditya Raje\nLighting : Amar Patel, Devender Parmar\nRendering : Hitendra Singh , Aditya Raje, Devender Raje , Amar Patel\nLighting : Amar Patel, Devender Parmar\nShading, Texturing and Matte Painting : Khayali Pandya, Amar Patel, Keyur Patel, Devender Parmar, Ranjit Mondal\nSound Design : Shalini Agarwal, Akash Chowdhary\nSFX Recording : Shalini Agarwal, Mustak Shaik\nFoley Artists : Gupta, Sajjan, Choudhury\nFX, Dynamics and Simulation : Nilesh Dhore, Keyur Patel, Anik Roy\nLead Compositors : Nilesh Dhore, Mohammad Azeem\nCompositing Team : Vinod Shetty, D.

        "description": "Let‚Äôs Eat is a 8 minute animated short film that centers on the relationship between a mother and daughter in a Chinese-American immigrant family. Let‚Äôs Eat strives to be a universal story told through a distinctly Asian-American voice.\n\nAs a single parent in an unfamiliar country, Ma‚Äôs entire life centers around raising Luan, her rambunctious young daughter. Likewise, Luan spends her childhood indulging in endless quality time with her playful, loving mother. However, as Luan grows up, it isn‚Äôt long before daily life interferes and causes mother and daughter to grow apart. By channeling their feelings into cooking, the two strive to find their way back to each other, one homemade meal at a time.\n\nMa and Luan‚Äôs tale touches upon mother-daughter relationships, the American immigrant experience, and the unspoken translation of love into food - familiar themes reflected through a fresh perspective often overlooked in mainstream media. We at Anamon Studios aim to share in our similarities as much as we celebrate our differences, and to this end we hope that Let‚Äôs Eat will resonate with audiences of all backgrounds and experiences.\n\nwww.letseatshortfilm.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/letseatshortfilm\n@letseatshortfilm\n\n***************************************************************************\n\"Come Back Home\" by Max Loh ft.

Featured on http://www.cgmeetup.net/home/le-gouffre/\n\nAn inspiring tale about friendship, sacrifice and conquering the impossible.\n\nLe Gouffre is the first animated short film produced and directed by Lightning Boy Studio, a young creative team based in Montreal. The film tells the story of two spirited travelers who come across an incredibly wide chasm on their journey and decide to build a bridge to cross it. Released in February 2015, the project had first gained a lot of attention following the huge success of its Kickstarter campaign, which allowed the creators to finance the movie's post-production. Many were impressed by the passion and determination of the small team of three animators, who spent more than two full years creating the 10-minute film.\n\nAs of now, Le Gouffre has been selected in more than 60 festivals around the world and won nine awards, four of them for \"Best Animated Short\".\n\n- CREDITS -\nDirected by : Carl Beauchemin, Thomas Chr√©tien, David Forest\nMusic : Dan Cullen, Deryn Cullen\nFoley and Sound Design : Mark Donis\nAnimation and Rigging : Carl Beauchemin\nArt Direction and Animation : David Forest\nVisual Effects and Compositing : Thomas Chr√©tien\nVoice Actors : Nicolas Charbonneaux, Charles-Andr√© Gaudreau, √âlisabeth Forest\nFinal Sound Mixing : Jean-Pierre Bissonnette\nOnline : Birck Fulham\n\n- AWARDS -\nBest CG Animation Short - 3D World Magazine CG Awards 2015\nAward of Excellence in Filmmaking or Screenwriting - Canada International Film Festival 2015\nJury Special Prize - Cin√©ma des Peuples Festival 2014\nBest Animation - Harlem International Film Festival 2014\nBest Animation - San Jose International Short Film Festival 2014\nBest Animation - Youngcuts Film Festival 2014\nAudience Favorite - SPASM Festival 2014\nAudience Favorite - Animated Short - 2nd Place\nPalm Springs International ShortFest 2014\nBest Visual Effects - Golden Orchid International Animation Festival 2014\n\n- THE TEAM-\nLightning Boy Studio was born in 2012 out of a shared passion : to tell great stories. The three founders met in animation school in 2009 and have dreamed ever since to be able to work together on projects of their own. Le Gouffre is the result of their first collaboration. The team is now working on a new idea for an animated feature film and is looking for partners and investors to join in on this adventure.\n\nWebsite: http://www.legouffre.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/filmlegouffre\n\nTeaser for New project Shadow of the Dino Kings \nhttps://www.facebook.com/dinokingsmovie/videos/541800099507212 \nhttps://www.facebook.com/dinokingsmovie\n\nSUBSCRIBE to CGMeetup for more inspiring content! http://bit.ly/Sub2CGMeetup\nWatch More CGI & VFX Animated Short Films: http://bit.ly/2DTJARP\n\nAbout CGI & VFX Animated Short Films: \nTake a look at our curated list of CGI & VFX Animated Short Films created by CGI artists and studios from all around the globe.\n\nFOLLOW US:\nWebsite: http://www.cgmeetup.net and http://www.cgmeetup.com\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/CGMeetUp\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/CGMeetup\nTwitter https://twitter.com/cgmeetup\nGoogle+ https://plus.google.com/+Cgmeetup\nDailymotion http://www.dailymotion.com/user/CGMeetup\nPinterest https://www.pinterest.com/cgmeetup/\nInstagram https://instagram.com/cgmeetup/\n\nWANT TO GET FEATURED?\nAll CGI artists, studios or schools who would like their work featured or published on CGMeetup please apply below.

Thanks to this particular genre, we have been able to witness an exciting array of remarkable, mind-boggling movies. But, while it is true that we fondly remember flicks like The Terminator, Independence Day, Men In Black, The Matrix, Inception, and Avatar amongst many others, there also seems to be an entire range of the sci-fi genre that has simply been brushed aside. So, in today‚Äôs video, we are going to take a peek at 11 of these underrated gems from the ‚Äô90s that undoubtedly deserve your time."

        "description": "The Akha in Laos live almost untouched by modern civilization. They still adhere to their archaic customs. But they are on the verge of upheaval. \n\nCut off from the rest of the world, without a paved road, the village of Peryensang Mai has remained almost untouched by modern civilization to this day. Its inhabitants are from the Akha tribe, and they seem to live in a different time: Their language isn‚Äôt even written down; their everyday life is defined by the laws and rituals handed down from their ancestors such as animal sacrifices to ward off bad luck. This adherence to customs that are often quite brutal endows the Akha‚Äôs lives with stability and direction. The women of the village have a particularly busy life. Because the Akha are largely self-sufficient, their tasks range from agriculture to housework and making traditional clothing. This documentary tells the story of the Laovan family. Mother Yeapheun has always had to work hard to support her large family. Her husband is the village elder and ensures the Akha observe the strict laws and commandments. The couple and their eldest children cannot imagine life beyond the mountaintop, so the family is pinning its hopes on youngest son Kienglom, who has been going to school in a nearby town since he was eleven years old. Like many mountain tribes in Laos, the Akha are facing a difficult choice: between a move down into the valley, which would mean they would have electricity, running water and better medical care - but also abandoning their ancient rituals. The film takes the viewer on an emotional journey of discovery to a tribe torn between tradition and modernity and facing the need to reinvent itself in today's world.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

        "description": "This is the story of Japan. In this video, I explore the long and unique history of Japan, the diverse geography of Japan - an archipelago of mountains, forests and volcanoes, the Japanese Economy - perhaps the most sophisticated in the world, and the remarkably rich Japanese culture that has influenced the world in so many ways.\n\nüïêCHAPTERSüïñ\nüëâ0:00 Opening Montage\nüëâ1:57 Introduction and Titles\nüëâ3:15 Origins and Early History\nüëâ7:14 Modern History\nüëâ15:16 Government\nüëâ17:01 Physical Geography\nüëâ22:17 Human Geography and Language\nüëâ25:13 Economy\nüëâ28:07 Culture and Summary\nüëâ31:22 Outro\n\nJapan's history as old and rich as any, and is strongly influenced by its geography, an island chain isolated at the end of the Eurasian continent. Its origins begin in the myths of the first Emperor of Japan, with recorded history beginning in the with the Yamato state of the 1st Century AD. Buddhism came to Japan in the 6th Century and fused with the native Shinto religion, which has continued to this day. Various dynasties went forward in the Asuka Period, the Nara Period where the capital of Japan moved to Kyoto, the Heian Period and the Kofun Period where the power of the Shogun, a military commander with greater power than the Emperor began.\n\nBut the Shogun's power waned until by the 15th Century, competing warlords (\"Daimyo\") fought each other in what became known as the Sengoku Period (\"Warring States\"). Samurai warriors, who ruled their lives by the Bushido Code, fought each other for 150 years. Oda Nobunaga was the one who ultimately triumphed out of the chaos, but he was soon assassinated, and his successor Tokugawa Ieyasu became Shogun after one final contest, the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The Shogun Tokugawa moved his court to Edo, later renamed Tokyo, and for the next 250 years, peace and isolation reigned in this Edo Period, as foreigners were expelled.\n\nThe Edo Period came to an end in 1860 as Admiral Perry of the USA forced Japan to open up. The Shogun was deposed and the emperor restored to power in what became known as the Meiji Restoration. In the next few decades, Japan went from a feudal society to a modern industrialised nation. But this progress was overshadowed by the rise of ultra-nationalist politicians under Hideki Tojo, who invaded China, leading to the Nanking Massacre, and the entry of Japan into World War II. The Empire of Japan was short lived, however, as Great Britain and the USA pushed back its forces, and the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki saw the unimaginable surrender of the country in August 1945.\n\nSince the war, the Japanese Economic Miracle took place, as Japan went from ruins to the #2 Economy in the world by the early 1970s. It soon dominated electronics, robotics and automotive sectors, with Japanese brands such as Sony, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Canon and Panasonic becoming household names.\n\nThe geography of Japan comprises four main islands Hokkaido in the north, the largest island of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu in the south. Okinawa is also notable, part of the Ryukyu island chain that extends as far as Taiwan. Earthquakes are a continual menace to Japan, with the most recent devastating Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 resulting in a devastating tsunami that led to the loss of 10,000s and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima.\n\nJapanese culture is easily among the world's richest, with its art, ikebana, bonsai and Japanese garden design prized around the world. It has a rich tradition of martial arts, from samurai to judo, karate to sumo. Its cuisine of ramen, sushi, teppan and teriyaki is sophisticated and popular the world over. Manga and anime are the latest globally desired trend of a tradition of centuries of illustration. Japanese strength in both electronics, art and story-telling resulted in its early entry into video games, which it continues to dominate to the present.\n\n--\nüì∑üìπüé• VIDEO & PHOTO CREDITS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\nüëâ https://geodiode.com/nse/japan#creditscore \n\nTitle Music: \"Japan Travel\" by Cyril Nikitin\n\nEnd Music\nShizima3 by PeriTune | http://peritune.com (Creative Commons 4.0)\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com\n\n--\n\nPlease support the development of this channel by remembering to üëç Like, üîÅ Share and üî¥ Subscribe.\n\nYou can also support the production of series like this by becoming a monthly sponsor with Patreon for as little as $2/month üëâ https://patreon.com/geodiode ü•∞\n\nMedia Procurement Assistance, Spanish CC Translation: Richard Torres\n\nNarrated, Written and Produced by\nB.J.Ranson\n\nYou can contact me via the website at üëâ https://geodiode.com/contact\nOr you can send an email via this Youtube Channel page üëâ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1raaXFgsFBSFR8qNgchF2g/about"

        "description": "Taking up half the continent of South America, Brazil is host to vast array of landscapes and biomes - from the steamy Amazon Rainforests, to the savannah of the Planalto Central, and the lush Atlantic Forests. üáßüá∑\n\nOne of the largest countries in the world in terms of land area and population, it is a unique blend of cultures from Europe, Africa and the native land itself. The history of Brazil is one of colonial exploitation and slavery, that, despite the efforts of enlightened leaders such as Dom Pedro II under the Empire of Brazil, today sees corruption and social inequality hold back what would otherwise already be a major global power. üáßüá∑\n\nDespite its colonial past Brazil worked hard to enter the modern age in the 20th Century under presidents such as Getulio Vargas, and a new capital at Brasilia began in 1960s after a massive modernistic building program under the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The economy continued to expand despite political repression under the dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s, with companies such as Embraer joining an elite club of international aerospace companies developing large aircraft. Brazilian politics has never been quiet and the current president of Jair Bolsonaro continues to divide opinion both at home and abroad. üáßüá∑\n\nA global giant in agriculture, it has become self-sufficient in terms of energy needs, and its manufacturing size is now only second to the USA in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most iconic and famous of all world cities, while giant S√£o Paulo beats even New York in size to be the largest city in the Americas. Indeed Brazil's population is truly massive, over 200 million call themselves Brazilian, and live in diverse cities across all of the States of Brazil, from Curitiba in the South, Belo Horizonte in the centre of Minas Gerais, to Salvador Bahia and Recife in the North-East, and lastly, unique Manaus in the heart of the Amazon. üáßüá∑\n\nThis is the country that brought Samba, Carnival and Bossa Nova to the world and we look at the development and history of this globally influential rhythms.

This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. \n\nWe start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.\n\nThis is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.\n\nTo me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species. \n\nFeaturing the voices of David Attenborough, Craig Childs, Brian Cox, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michelle Thaller, Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, Mike Rowe, Phil Plait, Janna Levin, Stephen Hawking, Sean Carroll, Alex Filippenko, and Martin Rees.\n\nBig thanks to Protocol Labs for their support of this creation: https://protocol.ai/ \n\nAnd to my Patreon supporters: Juan Benet, Kalexan, Laine Boswell, Holly, Dave & Debbie Boswell, Abraxas, Alina Sigaeva, Aksel Tj√∏nn, Daniel Saltzman, Crystal, Eico Neumann, geekiskhan, Giulia Carrozzino, Hannah Murphy, Jeremy Kerwin, JousterL, Lars St√∏ttrup Nielsen, Leonard van Vliet, Mitchel Mattera, Nathan Paskett, Patrick Cullen, Randall Bollig, Roman Shishkin, Silas Rech, Stefan Stettner, The Cleaner, Timothy E Plum, Virtual_271, Westin Johnson, Yannic, and Anna & Tyson.\n\nSoundtrack now available: https://bit.ly/2HKl9fi and coming soon to iTunes/Spotify/Etc\n\nPeace and love,\n\nmelodysheep\n@musicalscience\nmelodysheep.com\n\nConcept, music, writing, edit, and visual effects by melodysheep, with additional visual material sourced from:\n\nNASA Goddard\nGoogle\nSpaceX\n2012\nGeostorm\nInto the Universe with Stephen Hawking\nBMW X1 \nJourney to the Edge of the Universe\nNoah\nHow the Universe Works\nDeep Impact\nWonders of the Universe\nMoon raker vfx reel\nVoyage of Time\n\nif you found the text hard to read, check out the large text version:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQpfueZkJ-4\n\nVoice sample sources:\n\nAttenborough Davos Speech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuudPum21nE\nCraig Childs - Long Now Talk http://longnow.org/seminars/02013/jul/29/apocalyptic-planet-field-guide-everending-earth/\nBrian Cox - Wonders of the Universe Episode 1 \nNeil deGrasse Tyson interview with Bill Moyers https://vimeo.com/84075447\nHow the Universe Works - Season 3 Episode 2 \nWill The Universe Ever End with Lawrence Krauss https://www.closertotruth.com/series/will-the-universe-ever-end#video-2549\nJanna Levin TED Talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLz9TvxGoKs\nA Brief History of Time (1991) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAfxKExKjVQ\nWhat Happens in the Far Far Future https://www.closertotruth.com/series/what-happens-the-far-far-future\nSean Carroll TEDxCaltech https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaTyg8wR4Y\nAlex Filippenko - TEDxSF https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gAtPyEu0G4\nTo Infinity and Beyond: The Accelerating Universe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKdA2-W0X0\nMartin Rees interview http://www.closertotruth.com/series/what-happens-the-far-far-future#video-3625\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttps://amara.org/v/oIuX/"

(Aired January 10, 2018)\n\nOfficial Website:  https://to.pbs.org/3P9TdDL | #novapbs \n\nBlack holes are the most enigmatic and exotic objects in the universe. They‚Äôre also the most powerful, with gravity so strong it can trap light. And they‚Äôre destructive, swallowing entire planets, even giant stars. Anything that falls into them vanishes‚Ä¶gone forever. Now, astrophysicists are realizing that black holes may be essential to how our universe evolved‚Äîtheir influence possibly leading to life on Earth and, ultimately, us. In this two-hour special, astrophysicist and author Janna Levin takes viewers on a journey to the frontiers of black hole science. Along the way, we meet leading astronomers and physicists on the verge of finding new answers to provocative questions about these shadowy monsters: Where do they come from? What‚Äôs inside? What happens if you fall into one? And what can they tell us about the nature of space, time, and gravity?\n\nChapters\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:10:23 What Is A Black Hole?\n00:18:45 How Does A Black Hole Form?\n00:24:40 What Would Happen If You Traveled Into A Black Hole?\n00:29:58 The First Detection of A Black Hole: Cygnus X-1\n00:50:47 The Relationship of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies\n01:12:21 How Do Black Holes Grow?\n01:30:56 New Technologies Giving New View of Black Holes\n01:50:02 Conclusion\n\n¬© 2018 WGBH Educational Foundation\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nThis program was produced by GBH, which is solely responsible for its content. \n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

        "description": "Welcome to our captivating journey through the fascinating realm of ancient megaliths. In this documentary blog, we will embark on an exploration of remarkable sites scattered across the globe, where colossal stone structures have stood the test of time, leaving us in awe of the advanced skills and ingenuity of our ancient ancestors. From Japan to Peru, from Egypt to Micronesia, these monumental megaliths have puzzled archaeologists, historians, and scientists for centuries. Let's delve into the mysteries surrounding each site and unlock the secrets that lie within.\n\nOur journey commences in Japan's Asuka region, home to the enigmatic Japanese megaliths. These massive stone structures, with their mysterious purposes and intricate carvings, offer a glimpse into the ancient beliefs and customs of the people who once inhabited this land. From towering monoliths to impressive tombs, the Asuka Japanese Megaliths captivate us with their grandeur and raise intriguing questions about their origin and significance.\n\nNext, we venture to Peru to unravel the enigma surrounding the Saywhite Strange Monolith. Rising from the rugged landscape, this peculiar stone formation astounds us with its unique shape and intricate carvings. Join us as we explore the theories surrounding its creation and its potential connection to the ancient civilizations that flourished in the region.\n\nOur quest takes us to the heart of Cusco, Peru, where we encounter the Intihuatana Sundial Megalith. This celestial timekeeping device, perched high in the mountains, reveals the astronomical prowess of the ancient Inca civilization. Journey with us as we uncover the secrets hidden within the Intihuatana and delve into the profound connection between the Inca people and the cosmos.\n\nPrepare to be astounded as we return to Japan to witness the mesmerizing Ishi No Hoden, a floating stone that defies the laws of gravity. How was this massive stone suspended in mid-air without any visible support? Explore the theories behind this perplexing phenomenon and ponder the advanced knowledge possessed by the ancient builders who crafted this astonishing marvel.\n\nVenturing to Central America, we arrive at the ancient Mayan city of Quirigua in Guatemala. The Megalithic Park within this archaeological site presents us with intricately carved stelae and towering stone monuments that depict the rich Mayan history and culture. Join us as we unravel the stories behind these megalithic wonders and gain insight into the lives of the Mayan people.\n\nOur exploration continues in Bolivia, where we encounter the mind-boggling Puma Punku. This site, characterized by its massive stone blocks intricately fitted together, challenges conventional theories about ancient construction techniques. Witness the precision engineering and extraordinary craftsmanship displayed in every colossal stone, compelling us to question the capabilities of ancient civilizations.\n\nOur journey takes us to the land of pharaohs, Egypt, where we uncover evidence of advanced machining techniques employed by the ancient Egyptians.

        "description": "Bamboo stores water in its hollow segments for survival. From my observations, you can find this water in young stalks, particularly those near water sources or after prolonged heavy rains. The water undergoes natural filtration through the plant's roots and tissues, giving it a slightly sweet taste and making it drinkable. The young bamboo tissue is quite easy to pierce with a knife. Simply make one or two holes (at the top and bottom) to enjoy the refreshing bamboo water!\n\nüëã About me:\nhttps://linktr.ee/Shiklina\nüíãSubscribe to my social networks:\nhttps://instagram.com/marusya.shiklina\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@marusya.shiklina\nHello üôã‚Äç‚ôÄ\nPlease leave a comment ‚úç\nThis will help my channel üíù\nAnd if you have someone to share my video with, please send it‚ùó\nAlso like my video if you liked it üëç\nAnd subscribe to my channel üì∫ :  @marusya_outdoors  \nü•∞Your donations help develop my activities!

Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.\n\nI started a company called CrunchLabs where we build a toy together and then I teach you all the juicy physics for how it works. So if you want to learn to think like an engineer and have really fun time doing it, check out the current promotion where you get 2 FREE boxes at https://crunchlabs.com\n\nYou should also go subscribe to the CrunchLabs YouTube channel cause we‚Äôve got some bangers in the pipeline- https://www.youtube.com/crunchlabs\n\nThanks to these folks for providing some of the music in the video:\n\nPonder - https://youtube.com/@Pondermusic\nLaura Shigihara - @supershigi\nAndrew Applepie - https://soundcloud.com/andrewapplepie\nBlue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday"

Cole]\nWould you believe me if I said I'm in love?\nBaby, I want you to want me\nWould you believe me if I said I'm in love?\nBaby, I want ya\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nGot me up all night\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nAll I'm singin' is love songs\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nGot me up all night\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nShe got me\nAnd we are, we are, we are\nShe got me\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nWell this has gotta be the longest crush ever\nIf I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever\nLove is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever\nAnd, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?\nShe on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga\nWifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga\nLike, give me 20 dolla, dolla\nAss stupid, how you get to college, college\nI'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now\nWent and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now\nCan't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche?\nI used to pop up on you at the mall each day\nNow typically I kick game like Eastbay\nBut you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', \"Please play!\"\nFor Pete's sake, homie pull it together\nJust fuck her one time and be through it forever\nBut...\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n[Hook 1]"

This isn't the first abandoned puppy we meet and sadly it won't be the last. We will help him find adopters and loving home.\n\n\nWe have set up a PayPal donation account: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9DRB2N999KDA&source=url\n\nOr  bank account: \n\nName: Desislava Gospodinova\nIBAN: BG47UNCR70001523226502\nSWIFT/BIC: UNCRBGSF\n\n------------ \n\nWe are Stoyan and Dessy from Bulgaria. We are not organization, neither a shelter, we are just an ordinary couple with a big dream. Everything we provide for the stray cats is coming from our own pockets or with the help of donations from our subscribers. We have 4 cats at home, all rescued from the streets - Sopolcho & Bagheera live with us while Alexa & Rijo live with Dessy's mom, who has been feeding and caring of stray animals for the last 10 years. Bulgaria is a small and poor country with lots of stray cats and not enough kind people to take them in. Our dream is to build a shelter where we could take care of many stray cats with the help of Dessy's mom. If you would like to support us, please subscribe to our channel and share our videos with your friends and family. It would mean a lot to us ‚ù§Ô∏è\n- Dessy & Stoyan \n\nAbandoned Puppy Followed Us Home And We Let Him In\nAbandoned Puppy\nPuppy Followed Me Home\nPuppy Rescue\nDog Rescue"

Repeat after me:\n\nMammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish\nMammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish\n\nHedgehog:\nMost mammals don‚Äôt come in eggs like all the others\nThe babies drink milk from their mothers\nAnd we all have fur or hair on our soft skin\nWe have cats, deer, platypus, kangaroos, and you\nFun fact: whales and bats are mammals, too \n\nTurtle:\nReptiles are covered in scales or bony plates\nYeah, we know you can‚Äôt relate\nWe lay eggs with a leathery shell\nWe have snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and turtles, as well\n\nToucan:\nBirds are born from hard-shelled eggs\nWe have beaks and feathers, but scales on our legs\nNot all of us take to the sky\nBut most of us have hollow bones and most of us fly\n \nFrog:\nAmphibians lead a double-life in cold blood\nOur metamorphosis takes us from the water to the mud\nWe start with gills, then we graduate to lungs\nSome of us catch food with our specialized tongues\nSome of us look like worms, and some of us are long\nAnd some of us are toads, but most of us are frogs\n\nShark:\nFish, fish, fish are the largest groups of vertebrates\nAnd we‚Äôve been around much longer\nWe have scales and fins, we‚Äôre ectothermic\nAnd we lay our eggs in the water\nAnd guess what: a jellyfish is not a fish cause it doesn‚Äôt have a backbone‚Ä¶\nSame with starfish, shellfish, cuttlefish, and crayfish. These are fake fish \nOk, I‚Äôm done... But they‚Äôre fake\n\nThere are so many ways to divide up the data\nBut we all have spines in subphylum Vertebrata (subphylum Vertebrata! subphylum Vertebrata!)\n\nMammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish (Shark: but only the real ones!)\nMammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish\nBird, Amphibians, and fish\n\nCopyright ¬© 2021 Hopscotch"

        "description": "Amphibians and reptiles encompass a wide variety of species, each with its unique characteristics and adaptations. Here are the main types of amphibians and reptiles:\n\nüî¥Amphibians:\n\nüü¢Frogs: Frogs are known for their strong hind legs, which are adapted for jumping. They have moist, smooth skin and lay their eggs in water.\n\nüü¢Toads: Toads are similar to frogs but typically have rougher, warty skin. They also lay their eggs in water.\n\nüü¢Salamanders: Salamanders have long, slender bodies and tails. Many species are fully aquatic, while others live on land and return to water to breed.\n\nüü¢Newts: Newts are a type of salamander that often have brightly colored skin during the breeding season.\n\nüî¥Reptiles:\n\nüü¢Turtles: Turtles are known for their bony shell that protects their body. They can be aquatic (living in water) or terrestrial (living on land).\n\nüü¢Lizards: Lizards are a diverse group of reptiles that come in various sizes and shapes. They have scales, moveable eyelids, and most have legs.\n\nüü¢Snakes: Snakes are elongated, legless reptiles. They come in a wide range of sizes, from tiny snakes to giant pythons and boas.\n\nüü¢Alligators: Alligators are similar to crocodiles but have U-shaped snouts and are primarily found in North America and China.\n\nüü¢Tortoises: Tortoises are land-dwelling turtles with sturdy legs and a dome-shaped shell. They are herbivorous and slow-moving.\n\nüü¢Chameleons: Chameleons are unique lizards known for their ability to change color. They have specialized eyes and long, sticky tongues for catching insects.\n\nüü¢Iguanas: Iguanas are large lizards known for their distinctive crest of spines along their backs. Some species are arboreal (tree-dwelling).\n\nüü¢Geckos: Geckos are small to medium-sized lizards with adhesive toe pads that allow them to climb on vertical surfaces.\n\n#kidsvideo \n#cuteanimals \n#englishforkids"

        "description": "Here's a 3:30pm show during the midst of Spring Break 2021! This Orca Encounter was unique because the whales had switched the back pools they usually come out of (it's usually Trua and Makaio from the left and Katina, Nalani, and Malia from the right)! This didn't hold them back though and I thought this show was lovely! Highlights below as usual:\nPro tip: the 3:30 Orca Encounter usually has the highest attendance and will reach capacity much faster. You want to be there as early as possible or choose a different time!\n\n0:34 - One Song with Makaio and Trua, starting with Makaio's front flip\n- 1:14 I thought that was a good clip of Makaio's center belly breach\n- 2:15 Trua slides out! This shows how big he's been getting\n\n5:10 - Husbandry Demonstration and Volunteer Segment with Katina, Nalani, and Malia, starting with their spin swims\n- 7:30 Malia and Nalani doing the slideout/weight demonstration\n- 8:45 Katina tongue kisses through the glass\n-10:32 Nalani gets super high on her back breach!\n\n12:30 The Hunt/Splash Segment with Trua and Makaio\n-13:20 Both boys splashed very well this time!\n-14:04 Trua's fluke splash zippers!\n\n17:15 One Big World with Nalani, Katina, and Malia, starting with Nalani's stage slide\n-18:55 Malia's front flip! She's been opening her mouth on these the past year or so\n-19:57 Nalani, Malia, and Katina's kicker! (thumbnail)\n-20:30 They all slideout together!\n\nMakaio, Trua, Katina, Nalani, and Malia (Killer Whales) at SeaWorld Orlando on April 8, 2021.\n\nOfficial Instagram (Photos and Reels)\n‚û§ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/echo_beluga/\n\nFlickr Trip Reports (Account Required)\n‚û§ Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/echobeluga/\n\nDo not use without permission."

If I did the experiment again, I would want to test human blood vs. fish blood.  \n\nThis is the most definitive study done to date in a control lab environment on what is least and most interesting to them:  The Biology of Sharks and Rays Peter A. Klimley and Steven Oerding;  ISBN-13: 9780226442495. Particularly pages 134-140.

So I went to the Bahamas in shark infested waters and set up an experiment to get to the bottom of things.\n\n\nMERCH-\nThey are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markrober\n\n\nPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub\n\n****************************************¬≠\n\nI make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:\n\nCHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTube\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTube\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRober\n\nINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

MORE INFO: \n\nFrom the cinematographer: \"The footage for this film was shot over a period of some years in French Polynesia, Micronesia, Indonesia and East Timor. Unfortunately there are not that vibrant anymore today. Coral reefs have suffered from the rise of water temperature, rise in acidity, destructive fishing methods and severe storms caused by climate change.\" - Peter Schneider.  \"Rainbow Reef Relaxation\" is a 3-hour long, sweeping yet majestic & vibrant underwater journey to the world's most beautiful lagoons, as captured by Nature Relaxation collaborator Peter Schneider (Underwatercam) paired with ambient underwater sounds and brand new ambient music by the Cynic Project. Filmed in High Definition several years ago, thanks to its age this film offers magical glimpses of an underwater world that is bursting with life, color, and beauty.\n\nDOWNLOAD/LICENSE @ https://www.naturerelaxation.com/products/rainbow-reef-relaxation-3-hr-dynamic-underwater-film-w-music-hd |  MORE INFO:  Unfortunately, reefs today in most of the world are suffering from severe bleaching and so with this film we hope to raise awareness by showcasing the divine beauty that only pristine underwater reefs can present, in hopes that it will motivate the viewer to take action and help save them before its too late!

You will not believe what you see in this video.\nTop 10 Strongest Predators in the Wild\n\n1. TIGER\nThe tiger is the most powerful predator that lives on land. The tiger is the largest extant cat species. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.\nTigers are patient hunters and can move slowly and quietly, stalking their prey for 30 minutes.\nA tiger's large canine teeth and powerful jaws are used to grab a prey animal by the neck and suffocate it. Also the tiger has been seen to beat a lion in most battles.\n\n2. LION\nThe lion is the second largest cat in the world. They live in groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. The lion can attack all other predators without fear.\nThe king of jungle we all know is not actually lion. The lion does not live in the jungle, it lives in the great savannah.\nThey are also extremely protective of their young and whoever approaches their cubs is in extreme danger. \nlions are very strong in herding and are this is the strongest herd in the world.\n\n3. JAGUAR \nJaguars are the only big cat in the America and the third biggest in the world after tigers and lions. They look a lot like leopards, which live in Africa and Asia.\nThe jaguar is not typically an aggressive animal. But when it becomes aggressive, it's with explosive force. It's an ambush predator. It can attack very quickly and with great force.\n\nüëâ You can activate the subtitles (All languages are active!)\nüëâ Follow us on instagram: https://instagram.com/blondifoks\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\nPREDATOR\nPredators are wild animals that hunt, or prey on, other animals. All animals need food to live. Predator animals need the flesh of the animals that they kill to survive. Weasels, hawks, wolves, mountain lions, and grizzly bears are all predators. Predators are carnivores, which means their diet consists of meat. Some predators, such as coyotes and bears, are also scavengers, meaning they will eat the carcasses of animals that they didn't hunt themselves.\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\n‚ô´Music Used‚ô´\nTrack: T-Mass - Ignoring My Heart [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nWatch: https://youtu.be/eT0tYnWX2sQ\nFree Download / Stream: http://ncs.io/ignoringmyheartYO\n\nSong: MusicbyAden - Summer Love\nMusic provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.\nCreative Commons - Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported\nVideo Link: https://youtu.be/bSW9_CNI4_w\n\nSong: Vlad Gluschenko - Palm Trees\nMusic provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.\nCreative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported\nVideo Link: https://youtu.be/qeUgJQPaKTA\n\n‚ùóI may have used small parts of your video.

        "description": "Hyenas have a knack for not minding their own business. Whether they‚Äôre welcome or not is unimportant to them. They just like crashing parties. Sometimes, however, they crash the wrong parties, and they get a piece of their own medicine. If you want to see hyenas in compromising circumstances, you‚Äôre at the right place as we countdown 12 times hyenas messed with the wrong animals. \n\n‚ñ∫ Subscribe For New Videos! ‚ñ∫ shorturl.at/krBX9 \n\nWatch our ‚Äú15 Unbelievable Animals That Saved Other Animals‚Äù\nvideo here: https://youtu.be/tz1xsj-N97c\nWatch our ‚Äú15 times crocodiles and alligators messed with the wrong opponent.‚Äù\nvideo here: https://youtu.be/EsMSi0CF3jE\nWatch our ‚Äú15 Times Land Animals Messed With The Wrong Opponent #2‚Äù\nvideo here:https://youtu.be/xjeWTwNXe-s\n\nLion\n\nIt turns out that the violent conflict between hyenas and lions over carrion stretches back to 37,000 years ago. The animosity between lions and spotted hyenas goes deep, and it is one of nature's most well-known rivalries and probably the most ferocious rivalry in the African Savannah, with both species having an incomprehensible loathing for one other. One thing Hyenas don‚Äôt want to do is crash a party full of male lions and that‚Äôs exactly what they do in this video, and you can see what happens as this male lion is in pursuit of this hyena with another lioness running by his side. It doesn‚Äôt look good for the scavenger. The female lays one paw on the hyena, but it‚Äôs not enough.\n\n However, the big male catches up to the hyena and it is game over in seconds for the lion‚Äôs fiercest enemy. Whether they are young or old, lions will kill every hyena insight. That‚Äôs how much they hate them, so when hyenas go around looking for trouble, they better make sure their clan is high in numbers, and not isolated where lions can strike at any time. These two massive lions find a small hyena that has been left behind by the clan. The lions are just walking right behind the hyena without striking it, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just a matter of time before they do. The hyena tries to escape with its tail between its legs, but that isn‚Äôt going to change the lion‚Äôs mind. I guess the lions are just toying with the hyena because it is quite young. When they‚Äôre standing there, they almost look like they‚Äôre all friends. \n\nThis hyena is praying for the lions to forget about it, but it doesn‚Äôt look like they will. However, the rest of the clan approaches, so this could change the odds for the lone hyena. Believe it or not, the hyena manages to get back to the clan and the lions don‚Äôt even bother chasing it. That‚Äôs what I call the luckiest hyena in the world. During this night footage, this male lion attacks the matriarch of the clan and mangles it badly. The matriarch tries its best to defend itself, but the male lion is too powerful. The matriarch‚Äôs back is broken, and it won‚Äôt survive this ordeal with a broken back. The lion leaves the matriarch there and chases the other hyenas because, on this night, the lion is not looking for food, it‚Äôs looking to kill whatever is in its path. \n\nWild Dogs\n\nIf there's enough food to go around, wild dogs and hyenas can get along fine, but a scarcity of prey can force them both out of their protected areas. The bottom line though is everyone's deadliest enemy is the hyena, and this includes wild dogs. There is a lot of discussions but not much action when wild dogs and hyenas meet. That's because neither of them wants to be the one to make the initial move. The hyenas chatter and giggle, while the wild dogs watch and think. This clip is a bit depressing. This hyena appears to have succumbed to these wild dogs, as it rests on the ground, seemingly unresponsive to the dogs' pinches and bites. \n\nIt‚Äôs rare to see a hyena in so much trouble unless it is attacked by a male lion, but this hyena is in big trouble and it‚Äôs time to bring in a priest to give it its last rites. These events happen daily, so life in the savannah is not all fun and games. These two hyenas are surrounded by a bunch of wild dogs and a small scuffle ensues. Both the dogs and the hyenas voice their opinions. The hyenas crack a joke or two and the dogs serenade them a little. After a little complaining from both sides, the animals disperse into the forest. In this video, about thirty or forty dogs maul this hyena to death. I guess these are hunting dogs that are let loose by their handlers. I don‚Äôt understand why people would hunt hyenas, but I guess they do it for a reason, whether it‚Äôs money or body parts to sell for money."

        "description": "Crocodiles are powerful apex predators, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they always come out on top. Some animals give them a run for their money and sometimes even defeat them. Sometimes they‚Äôre just having a bad day and things don‚Äôt go as expected. Do you think crocodiles are always successful when they hunt otters? What about big cats? Let‚Äôs find out together as we countdown  15 times crocodiles and alligators messed with the wrong opponent. \n\n‚ñ∫ Subscribe For New Videos! ‚ñ∫ shorturl.at/krBX9 \n\nWatch our ‚Äú15 Unbelievable Seagull Moments Caught On Camera‚Äù\nvideo here: https://youtu.be/jBlHOHcZejo\nWatch our ‚Äú15 Badass Ocean Creatures That Eat Land Animals‚Äù\nvideo here:  https://youtu.be/5GGcLnBeNCs\nWatch our ‚Äú15 Mythical CREATURES That Actually Existed‚Äù \nvideo here: https://youtu.be/yIqEkQ2Zgyw\n\nBaboon\n\nA troop of baboons can challenge even a big cat if they organize themselves but, in the water, against a crocodile, I don‚Äôt know how well they would fair. The attachment between a mother and her newborn baboon is quite profound, and they have a daily pattern that is like ours. Baboons are highly adaptable creatures that can be found in a wide range of settings in Central Africa. In this video, a smaller crocodile has snatched a baby baboon, but its mother jumps the crocodile and doesn‚Äôt give up until the crocodile lets the baby go which it eventually does, but the damage is already done. The mother baboon walks away with its baby in its arms, mourning its death. You can see in this video what I mean when I say a troop of baboons can manage to defeat a smaller crocodile. \n\nNot all the baboons are courageous enough to jump the crocodile, but a few of them are gutsier than the others and once they go for it, the others join in the frenzy. This next clip shows a baboon fighting for its life, trying to get out of a crocodile‚Äôs jaws. I must say, the baboon‚Äôs strength is impressive considering the crocodile‚Äôs pressure is immense. The poor baboon gets away, but it looks like it has some serious injuries to deal with and there are no hospitals in the vicinity. Finally, a Grey Langur had its arm trapped in the jaws of a Mugger Crocodile while drinking water. The battle lasted over an hour as the monkey fought for its life. Later, the monkey was able to free its arm from the jaws of its assailant. However, during the fight, the monkey broke its limb, which can be fatal in the wild. \n\nWild Boar\n\nWild boars are powerful animals that can move quickly. In the event of an attack, adult males' canines may cause severe injuries. However, when going up against a crocodile, the odds are against the wild boar. The crocodile is just too powerful, especially if the confrontation takes place in the water. In our first clip, this crocodile gets out of the water and sneaks up on some baby hogs. It looks like it‚Äôs going to be a cakewalk for the crocodile, but the entire family comes to the rescue and prevents the crocodile from approaching the youngsters. In this next clip, a bunch of wild hogs is in the water and an alligator approaches them. \n\nThe humans are throwing food close to the alligator as if they want one of the hogs to be ambushed by the alligator. A seriously deranged bunch of humans if you ask me. What had to happen, happens and the alligator attacks the hog, leaving it no chance. I don‚Äôt think wild pigs have a chance in hell against a crocodile or alligator attack when they‚Äôre in the water. Finally, this warthog pulls a few dances moves a la ‚ÄúJames Brown‚Äù and manages to escape the grip of this mighty crocodile"

I wanted to show the comparison between leopards and cheetahs this time.  There is a big difference and it is due to the nature of these two predators... based on tons of factors where their mindset and bodies were adapted to hunt a certain way to survive.  Where they live is just as important due to provided cover or not.\n\nThis is a simple test but does show the nature of these different cats when it comes to approach of their prey.   Both have the instinct of ambush, but leopards are masters of it while cheetahs depend mostly on their speed.  A leopards hunts mostly from forested areas while cheetahs live and hunt in the open plains.\n\nThere are so many factors and reasons why.  Size, strength, muscle mass, body types, prey, landscapes, mindsets of the two and so much more.  A whole thesis could be written and we're just talking  about leopards versus cheetah ambush styles.\n\nThe wild cheetahs at Cheetah Experience don't like anyone and won't come close to me to test ambushing.  But the tamed ones just don't care about your back because that is not their normal way of predation.  They don't need to ambush their prey because none of their prey can out run a cheetah.\n\nAnyway... enjoy the video but don't go thinkin you can just walk into any cheetah enclosure and not get jumped on for any reason.  I am cautious and have foreknowledge about the nature of these animals and individuals, like I mention in this video.  So please don't.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nP.S.  Some seem to think I have an uncanny resemblance to Louis C.K. who is an American comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker.  He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor.  Maybe on day I'll impersonate him and interact with these cheetahs, minus any dark humor of course.  Not my style.\n\nMy YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC25bqOksVyD-SfdAToam-Bg\n\nIntro Music:  Mountain Trek - Underground Music Library - Amotz Plessner.\nAlbum:  Hybrid Electric Orchestral (Trailer Cues)\nWebsite:  https://underground.sourceaudio.com/#!home\r\n\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/cheetah_petter\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/The-Cheetah-Whisperer-200126363927484/\nGoogle+:  https://plus.google.com/+DolphCVolker/posts\nPayPal:  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=UGXLLG5QK6RRC\n\nCheck Out My Books I Wrote\n1:  https://www.amazon.com/DIRE-ENCOUNTERS-Man-Meets-Wolf-ebook/dp/B00UEHUB2G\n2:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072N5M7KB"

Over 600 species of birds are found in Papua, including 27 bird-of-paradise species, many of which live nowhere else on earth.

Even if you could, good luck overcoming the frostbite-inducing temperatures of nearly -130 degrees Fahrenheit (-90 C). But where did these heavy restrictions come from? It all started when American Navy officer Admiral Byrd put forth plans for a special treaty, one which declared that Antarctica should remain a completely demilitarised zone and devoid of ownership by any one nation...  \n\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: david.f@valnetinc.com"

With the help of a one-of-a-kind local tracker, we find a female polar bear fresh out of her winter den with her tiny new cub. We see ultimate cuteness as the cub explores the world outside for the first time. Their irresistible interactions distract from the fact that the mother bear is actually making an impossible decision. The mother has spent the last eight months starving, so she is eager to rush to the ocean where she can hunt. But to reach the seal feast means a 40-mile trek. Does she wait to allow the cub to gain strength for the long trek, or does she head out to sea to make sure her milk doesn‚Äôt dry up?\n\nWe also follow a young female bear in her first moments of independence, having been kicked out by her mother. She has spent the last two and a half years with her mother preparing for this moment, but she quickly manages to get herself into trouble. Will she be able to survive a wolf on the hunt?\n‚û° Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n‚û° Get More Wildlife with Bertie Gregory: https://on.natgeo.com/2lNK5cQ\n\n#NationalGeographic #BertieGregory #WildlifeTheBigFreeze\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

        "description": "Polar bears dominate the Arctic animal headlines; it‚Äôs hard for anything to escape their shadow. In this episode we meet an unexpected array of smaller species that each have their own peculiar but no less entertaining strategies for surviving in this brutal environment. The tiny arctic fox might look cute, but it‚Äôs actually a killing machine. The arctic hare may be fluffy and have comical ears, but it‚Äôs both a master of camouflage and one of the fastest animals here. The snowy owl has sacrificed speed for a mightier secret weapon: silence. We find a lemming (a tiny brown rodent) running around in a blizzard, a big mistake when silent assassins are flying overhead. Although these unsung heroes are some of the few who‚Äôve perfectly adapted to this place, the environment is changing fast. Warming temperatures are allowing enemies to move north, encroaching on these Arctic specialists.\n‚û° Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n‚û° Get More Wildlife with Bertie Gregory: https://on.natgeo.com/2lNK5cQ\n\n#NationalGeographic #BertieGregory #WildlifeTheBigFreeze\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up. Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface. Earth‚Äôs crust is the only thing in their way. It feels solid to us, but it is only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth. True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined, subjecting the climate to centuries  worth of change in a single year, while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases: supervolcanoes.

I look in detail at the colossal 1883 eruption, the sounds that it made that put it into the record books, and the killer pyroclastic flows and tsunami that led to so many lives lost.\n\nI then look at Krakatoa in the context of other historical eruptions and as measured by the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI). Mount Tambora and Mount Toba, also in the same region are notable examples of other massive volcanic eruptions in recorded and geological history.\n\nLastly, I look at how the numerous volcanoes on Java have led to this island being the most populated on Earth, and end with a glimpse at what might lie in Krakatoa's future.\n\nüì∑üìπüé• VIDEO & PHOTO CREDITS ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nAnak Krakatoa 2018 - Frank Keurntjes - https://youtu.be/Kz695GAOpaQ\nAnak Krakatoa 2018 - humanizer - https://youtu.be/-uOa2unXLlw\nAnak Krakatoa 2018 - Ronny Quireyns / ARMA tu RAhttps://youtu.be/4zUAy5bSSF4\nSubduction zone - KDS4444 - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=49035989\nStratovolcano Cross-Section - Woudloper - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stratovolcano_cross-section.svg\nBatavia & 1883 Aftermath Photos - Tropenmuseum - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=114032823\nPumice Fragment - James St John - https://flic.kr/p/oTMfch\nDecibel Scale - Precision Rifle Blog - https://precisionrifleblog.com/2015/02/20/thunderbeast-suppressor/\nPyroclastic Flow - ING Vulcani - https://youtu.be/uSd0DCDmC6Y\nMauna Loa Eruption - Eastern Video Productions - https://youtu.be/FgCbqWE6__0\nTambora Ashfall - myself/NASA/Oppenheimer - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1266774\nEurope 1816 Temps - Giorgiogp2 - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8942703\nChange in Geography - ChrisDHDR (PD) - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6753740\nAnak Krakatoa 2008 - flydime - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3716726\n\nTitle Music: Modern Classic by Cyril Nikitin - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgPgFk0Rt_E\n\nPlease support the development of this channel by remembering to üëç Like, üîÅ Share and üî¥ Subscribe.\n\n\nhttps://360.org/ig/the-krakatoa-volcanic-eruption/\nquestions@360.org"

However, the sound wasn‚Äôt coming from the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack emitting gas and ejecting rocks, and would come to be known as the volcano Paricutin. Where do new volcanoes like this come from, and what triggers their unpredictable eruption?

        "description": "Ask This Old House landscape designer Jenn Nawada heads to Phoenix to recreate the desert in a homeowner‚Äôs front yard.\nSUBSCRIBE to This Old House: http://bit.ly/SubscribeThisOldHouse\n\nTime: 1 day\nCost: $2,000 and Up\n\nSkill Level: Moderate\n\nTools List for Creating a Desert Landscape:\nShovel\nWheelbarrow\nHand truck\nLevel\nCompacter\n\nShopping List:\nSoil\nBoulders\nVariety of desert plants\nCardboard\n_‚Äù stone\nModular pavers\n\nSteps:\n1. Dig out the outline of a walkway about 3‚Äô wide and 3-4‚Äù deep. Give the outline a slight curve to add visual interest to the walkway.\n2. To mimic the hills of the desert, shovel piles of soil onto the landscape into seemingly random mounds.\n3. Determine a few locations to place boulders in the landscape. Dig holes in those locations about 4‚Äù deep and roughly the width of the boulder being placed.\n4. Carefully load each boulder onto a hand truck, wheel it into position, and roll the boulder into its final place. Backfill around the hole to make it look like it really belongs there.\n5. Stage the variety of desert plants across the landscape. Things aren‚Äôt really clumped together in the desert, so keep the plants spread out. Be mindful of when plants bloom, if ever, to have an even spread of color across the landscape.\n6. Once each plant is in its desired position, plant them all with the shovel. Dig down just about as deep as the root ball and twice as wide.\n7. To plant cacti, wrap a piece of cardboard around the needles and move the cactus only by holding onto the cardboard.\n8. Give everything a good watering.\n9. Put down a layer of _‚Äù stone on the outlined walkway and level it.\n10. Compact the walkway with a compacter.\n11. Lay down the pavers over the walkway base in a running bond pattern.\n\nResources:\nIn any landscape design, Jenn recommends looking for natural cues in the surrounding area to recreate in a controlled way in your yard. In this case, she identified an abundance of small stones coating the ground, plants spread far apart from each other, and undulating hills. Those cues informed the design in the homeowner‚Äôs front yard.\n\nJenn installed boulders, red yucca, lantana, bougainvillea, a few variety of cacti, and a Chilean mesquite tree. These can be found at nurseries, particularly in the Southwest region of the US and in zones 9 and 10.\n\nExpert assistance for this segment was provided by Rod Pappas and Xeriscapes Unlimited, Inc.

        "description": "If you're looking to add some greenery to a desert landscape, consider planting some low-water trees. Not only will they help beautify your yard, but they will also provide shade and reduce the heat island effect in your neighborhood.\n\nWhen considering what to plant, remember to choose trees and plants that can thrive in our arid climate. In this blog post, we will discuss four trees that are perfect for low-water landscapes: Ironwood, Thevetia, Shamel Ash, Live Oak, as well as a bonus desert \"tree,\" the Ocotillo.\n\nWith a little planning, you can create a desert landscape that is stunningly beautiful while remaining water-thrifty!\n\nWhy is tree choice so important when planting in a desert climate?\n\nDesert trees have to be tough to survive the extreme heat, strong winds, and little rainfall that characterize desert conditions. They also need to be able to store water so they can stay hydrated during long periods of drought.\n\nIf you plant a tree that is not well-suited for the desert climate, it is likely to die during a heatwave or drought. Not only is this a waste of money, but it can also be dangerous if the weakened tree falls over in high winds.\n\nTo avoid these problems, make sure to choose desert-adapted trees when deciding which trees to plant in your central Arizona front or backyard.\nWhat are the best trees to plant in a desert landscape?\n\nBesides drought hardiness, there are other things to consider when choosing the best trees for your landscaping goals. The first is whether you want a deciduous or evergreen tree. Deciduous trees are those that lose their leaves in the winter, while evergreens keep theirs year-round.\n\nBoth have their advantages and disadvantages. Deciduous trees provide shade in the summer but not in the winter when they are leafless. Evergreen trees provide shade year-round but may drop needles or flowers, which can be a nuisance if you have lawn furniture or a pool.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the size of the tree at maturity. Some desert trees grow to be very large, while others stay relatively small. Make sure to choose a size that fits your landscape and won‚Äôt overwhelm your yard!\n\n1.  Ironwood Tree\n2.  Thevetia Tree\n3.  Shamel Ash Tree\n4.  Live Oak Tree\n \nHere is a bonus tree (not really a tree) that many HOA‚Äôs allow to replace trees and are zero maintenance;\n \n5.

I realised that even tigers have a history. He is also a creature running on social elements. There are more than 150 tigers in Tadoba Tiger Reserve, but the most famous of them are Maya, Matkasur and Waghdoh. Thier history is equally interesting as that of the mankind.

While staying at the Treehouse Lodge in the Amazon rain forest we had the opportunity to experience what it was like to live in a treehouse for the first time in our lives and partake a series of adventure travel excursions including fishing for piranhas, meeting friendly sloths, spotting all kinds of jungle wildlife native to the Amazon and feeding monkeys. We show you the entire experience from Amazon river cruise to feasting on ceviche to sleeping overnight in the tree house lodge.\n\nA special thanks to Rainforest Cruises for hosting our trip!\nWebsite: http://www.rainforestcruises.com/\n\nGEAR WE USE\nOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7t\nCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX \nOlympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM \nRode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM \nJoby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F \nSanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs \n\nSOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGS\n\nAUDREY:\nblog: http://thatbackpacker.com/\ninstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpacker/\nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpacker\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker \n\nSAMUEL:\nblog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ \nfacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel \ntwitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuel\ninstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/\n\nAmazon rainforest adventure travel in Peru at Jungle Treehouse Lodge Travel Video Transcript:\n\nSo we are staying in the coolest place ever. We have just arrived at the Treehouse Lodge in the middle of the Amazon jungle. And we're going to be living in a tree house for the next few days. So come along and I'm going to show you our personal private tree house. And we're living in a tree house! We're living in a treehouse!\nEvery kids dream.\n\nOkay, well we want to show you more of the property but right now we're about to head out on a jungle walk. We're going to be looking for medicinal plants and learning about their uses. It also just started pouring rain. So it is time for our jungle expedition.\n\nSo Sam, you look like you're ready for a jungle excursion.\nShow us your footwear. And here is the leaf that is used to make the Juane. The traditional food from the Amazon jungle here in Peru.\n\nSo we are back from the jungle excursion. Yeah, that jungle walk was awesome. We learned so much about all of the different local plants and what they are used for in terms of different medicinal properties and also for food. And now we're off on a cool boat trip. We're just going to be cruising down the Amazon and looking for pink dolphins. Yes and maybe we'll stick around for sunset too.\n\nMacau look! So we just spotted a sloth up in the tree. We wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't for our guide though. And this is sunset on the Amazon river. So that is the end of day one. How are you feeling about sleeping in this tree house? Awesome. A lot of adventure. \n\nWell, good morning it is the start of day two and it was sure raining last night. Like thunderstorms, the whole deal.\n\nWe're going to try and spot some wildlife. We went out for a little excursion this morning and we've been traveling upstream and now we've arrived at a prime location to fish piranhas. So Sam, how are you feeling about that? Feeling good because you're going to stick your fingers in and they're going to bite them, right?\n\nSo we've going to use this small fish. Oh! To feed the piranha.\nYou want to try to splash the water. That is the way how to attract the pira√±a. Splashing the water. Calling the piranha. Okay, so I'm going try my hand at fishing for piranhas. I've got the bait here. Right here. Let's do this. Our first pira√±a.\n\nLook at the teeth on that sucker. Oh my gosh I would not want to be bitten by one of those. That is scary.\n\nYou got one! Show it to us. I finally caught one. It was a big one too.\n\nThere you go. Sam's first piranha. Look at that. Probably my 20th attempt and I was not going to give up until I got one.\n\nNow it is time for lunch. We are having ceviche. Our favorite as an appetizer. Wow, look at that.\n\nSo we are about to go on one more excursion this evening but before we head out we want to show you the rest of the property. So let's go in search of some tree houses.\n\nWe are now entering the bamboo forest.\n\nOh! Are they fighting? Yeah. Squack. Alright, so Sam is going to feed a monkey. Yes, I've got my chunk of banana. Now time to throw it.\n\nSo right now we are trekking through the mud in search of giant lily pads.\n\nSo we are meeting a sloth that was apparently rescued by a family when it was really young. So it lives with them in the house and it is very sleepy and slow. So oh, but it has woken up. It is eating. Pablito? Pablito is having lunch.\n\nOkay so this morning we went fishing for piranha and now we are having it for dinner.\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Peru video series showcasing Peruvian food, Peruvian culture and Peruvian cuisine.  \n\nMusic in this video courtesy of Audio Network"

        "description": "Come with me down the Amazon River into the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest for a wild week of adventure. - http://www.tourist2townie.com/\n\nA BIG THANK YOU to Amazon Gero Tours and the entire staff for hosting me, and keeping me alive. \n\nFor the best Amazon Tour from Manaus, check them out - http://www.amazongerotours.com/\n\n- AMAZON ADVENTURE - \n\nThere are certain places on this planet that seem almost like fiction. \n\nUnreachable destinations that you expect to only see in story books and documentaries. \n\nThe Amazon Rainforest in northern Brazil was one of those places for me. \n\nSo when I had the opportunity to come to Brazil, I wasn't going to miss the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. \n\nMy experience began in the gateway city of Manaus, where the journey into the jungle proved to be a task unto itself...\n\nI took a taxi from the airport down to the city's main harbor. \n\nIt was here that had my first glimpse of the incredible size and scope of the Amazon river on ground level. \n\nFrom here I crossed the river on a small shuttle boat, passing the point where the Rio Negro converges with the Amazon which forms a really cool color divide in the water.\n\nOnce on the other side, I passed street vendors selling giant fish and wild fruits, before boarding an old VW wagon. \n\nPast the small towns and giant lilly pads, we drove further away from civilization before making one last transfer into a small motorboat.\n\nAs we weaved through the flooded forest, the reality of this experience started to set in! \n\nThe Ararinha Jungle Hotel would serve as the launch pad for all my Rainforest adventures. \n\nBy day we explored the river and trekked through the Amazon rainforest.\n\nIn the water we looked out for exotic birds, hidden lizards and even the rare pink dolphins and on land it was giant spiders, poison dart frogs and all types of monkeys. \n\nWhile the rare Anaconda and Jaguar were always in the back of my mind, it was the smaller animals that you really had to be aware of.     \n\nWe would go catch piranha in the shallow waters and then boat out to the middle of the river nearby to swim.\n\nIt was a dangerous and beautiful place, and my senses were heightened the entire time. \n\nThroughout the process, Kenrick and the other guides taught me some important skills and techniques for surviving in the jungle. From making weapons and building shelter to finding the best things to eat if you're hungry.\n\nAnother side of life in the Amazon, is the close-nit community of people who live along the river. I was expecting to see naked tribes and face-painted cannibals, but that wasn't the case at all. \n\nI had the opportunity to meet and interact with many local residents and despite the remote location, life here seems relatively normal, and it comes with an alluring simplicity and self-sufficiency. \n\nOne morning we visited one of local farms who were in the middle of cultivating the popular Brazilian staple, Farinha or Farofa. He should us how to transform the poisones root into an edible side-dish and I even popped my top to help out.\n\nOn another day we were invited to a house party with some of the off-duty guides and surrounding neighbors. \n\nIt was great to see what life was like on a Friday night with people my age in the Amazon.\n\nAnd at night, when the sensible locals would turn in, we'd launch the boat again and head out to explore the darkness. \n\nWith 75% of the animals here being nocturnal, the noises and commotion at night were like nothing I've ever heard.\n\nThe easiest thing to spot were caimans, whose beady red eyes surfaced across the river. And apparently, if you're fast and quiet enough, you can reach down into the water and grab one.\n\nOn my final day in the Amazon, we decided to take a small crew out to get the full effect of the jungle, and go camp out.\n\nWe found a flat, dry space not far from the river and worked quickly to setup camp before dark. \n\nWe chopped trees for a tarp frame, cautiously gathered firewood and began cooking dinner over the fire. \n\nAs darkness and a little paranoia set in, we enjoyed dinner and drinks to the developing sounds around us. \n\nWe listened to music, played cards, and of course, peed close by. \n\nWe had some more drinks, made hats out of palm branch and shared stories well into the night.\n\nAfter an camp-made breakfast with fresh fruit, eggs and coffee, it was time for me to pack up and head back to Manaus. \n\nAnd although I spent a week engulfed in this incredible place‚Ä¶ the people, the wildlife, the environment‚Ä¶ everything still makes the Amazon seem like fiction...\n\n- FOLLOW ALL THE ADVENTURES - \n\nBLOG - http://www.tourist2townie.com\nINSTAGRAM - https://instagram.com/tourist2townie/\nFACEBOOK - https://facebook.com/tourist2townie/\nTWITTER - https://twitter.com/tourist2townie/\n\n- TRAVEL DEEPER -"

This ancient species predates most dinosaurs, and is a dominant predator of the deep sea ecosystem. The lead scientist on the mission, FSU Marine Lab's Dr. Dean Grubbs, has been the first to put a satellite tag on one of these elusive sharks, but until now had only been able to do so by bringing them up to the surface.\n\nStay tuned for a full video from the mission coming up soon on #OceanX. Achieved as part of our ongoing partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies Vibrant Oceans Initiative (@bloombergdotorg) and The Moore Bahamas Foundation (@moorecharitable) to create One Big Wave for ocean conservation and stewardship. #sharkweek\n\nFOLLOW OCEANX FOR MORE EXPLORATION:  \nhttp://www.instagram.com/oceanx\nhttp://www.facebook.com/oceanxorg\nhttp://www.twitter.com/oceanx\nhttp://www.linkedin.com/oceanxorg\nhttp://www.oceanx.org"

        "description": "Subscribe to my channel - http://bit.ly/ReYOUniverse\n\nThe world's oceans are so underexplored that if you dive deeper than 3,500 meters, there's a good chance to discover a new species unknown to science. There's also a good chance you'll find debris and garbage. Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface. The average depth of the oceans is about 3.7 kilometers, and since light can only penetrate to a depth of 100 meters, darkness reigns deeper underwater. Let‚Äôs push this statement one step further and conclude that since most of the planet is covered by water, it means that most of the Earth exists in total darkness. Water in the oceans account for almost 96% of the Earth's water. The portion of fresh water compared to seawater is so small that if the fresh water that flows into the ocean is spread over the surface of the ocean, it would have been about 1.25 meters thick. According to the U.S. Journal of Science and Engineering, 94% of all life on Earth lives in water. It means that all of us who live on land belong to a very, very small minority. \nSo what mysteries lurk in the depths of the oceans? The deeper we go, the more curious it gets. It seems we know more about the surface of Mars than about the ocean floor of our planet. What's going on in the deepest places, we didn't know at all, at least until recently. Lack of light and extreme pressure makes this part of the ocean difficult to explore.\nToday we're going on a journey into the very depths. We're going to find out what the bottom of the ocean looks like, what it consists of and what happens there. Who knows what we will find there‚Ä¶ We are going to dive deep to the places with most elien conditions!\n What was found in the deepest places of the ocean?\n#marianatrench #ocean #reyouniverse"

        "description": "#fullepisode #animals #documentary #wildlife \n‚û° Subscribe: https://tinyurl.com/FreeHighQualityDocumentariesYT\n\nIn a land of dangers, plant-eating animals are always at risk, and never more so than at the time of their birth; out on the open they are vulnerable and there are few places to hide. But luckily some are born to run‚Ä¶\nOut on the African plains life can get off to a shaky start. Millions of baby wildebeests, zebras and antelopes are born at the same time. All of them must struggle to their feet in minutes. They must master their legs and be ready to run with the herd. If they don't they will be picked off by predators like lions, cheetahs, or crocodiles.\nWhatever their role in life, little ones will face one challenge after another, whether it's trying to keep up with the herd during migration, getting stuck in the mud during a drought, being separated from its mother, panicking in bad weather, or even coming face to face with a predator.\nThe point will come in every young animal's life when the skills it learned will be put to good use. One of the most powerful wake-up calls to the harsh reality of nature comes to a young wildebeest during its migration. A dramatic river crossing, where there are more than just fast currents and steep banks to deal with - a river teaming with crocodiles. One by one his herd mates are picked off by the great reptiles, but when his time comes he proves he was born to run!"

It's paired with a brand new ambient musical masterpiece by The Cynic Project (notes below). Edited & produced by David Huting and cinematography thanks to Stefan Zimmerman. MORE INFO & LINKS:\n\nNORWAY LOCATIONS SHOWN: Lofoten, Nustjord, Flakstad, Ramberg, Bidge to Torvoya, Ytresand Beach, Bj√∂rnsand, M√¶rvollspollen, Unstad, Grunnf√∏rfjorden sandbanks, Henningsv√¶r, Vikjorden, L√∏dingen, R√∏rvikstranda, Straumen. Filmed by Stefan Zimmerman on the DJI Phantom 4 Pro Drone. \n\nABOUT THE MUSIC: \"This production is a continuous mix of three ambient works, each work featuring a different Hatfield sister :) The first song features Erin Hatfield on vocals, and later on a beautiful sounding hang drum provides some rhythmic backing, then featuring a vocal solo by Erin Hatfield around the 10:00 mark. The second song is a remix from my game, Pixelsphere. The third song features Ashley Hatfield. Ashley's vocals are washed in reverb and linger as chord swells in the background which are combined with a boy's choir sound. My wife Julie Hatfield's lovely vocals are featured in all three songs. Big thanks to the vocalists Erin, Ashley and Julie for helping me with this composition!\" ~Alex Smith. MUSIC NOTES: This ambient score features a very unique instrument: the hang drum. From Alex: \"They are pretty cool and organic sounding kind of like a steel drum that you hold in your hand, with the exception that the instrument itself is a specific type of resonator so it the way it rings after it's struck with your palm.\" For more cynic project links & videos visit https://www.NatureRelaxation.com/cynicmusic or check out Alex's AWESOME side-scrolling musical game \"Pixelpshere\" at http://www.pixelsphere.org\n\nNATURE RELAXATION‚Ñ¢ APP STORE LINKS (Free to download/try):\niOS App: https://www.naturerelaxation.com/ios\nANDROID App: https://www.naturerelaxation.com/Android\nROKU App: https://www.naturerelaxation.com/Roku\nAPPLETV: Search for Nature Relaxation on the Apple TV store\nANDROIDTV app: https://www.naturerelaxation.com/AndroidTV\nAMAZON Fire TV App: https://www.naturerelaxation.com/AmazonFire\nSAMSUNGTV: Search for Nature Relaxation from your 7-series or newer TV app store.\n\n*BEST WAY TO ENJOY NATURE RELAXATION* If you are truly looking to relax while watching this, I strongly recommending leaving YouTube and watching via Nature Relaxation On-Demand, where you will enjoy zero ads, a much cleaner, distraction free viewing experience (no permanent clock when fullscreen, no clickbait videos, etc).

Then it's time to catch a breath! \n4. includes warm up exercises \n5. includes a cool down sequence in the end \n\nBut let's make this clear: I was still feeling a serious burn in my muscles and I was still sweating ‚ô•Ô∏é \nThis video is super effective and especially the SLOWNESS gives you so much room to perform everything concentrated, thinking of the exact muscles you want to train. The burn was seriously insane for me! \n\nNo Equipment necessary and not much space needed :)\nThe video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I‚Äôm doing 30s for each exercise. \n\nI recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

Women's events appeared for the first time at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, while the men's programme was standardised as of the 1932 Games in Los Angeles.

Because of that, it‚Äôs hard to know what to look for when you try to judge the sport from your couch. One thing that‚Äôs easy to see, though? The splash.\n\nIf you‚Äôve watched any Olympics diving coverage, you may have noticed that the splashes athletes make are tiny. Divers spend years training to perform with minimal splash, in the same way that gymnasts train to stick their landings.\n\nIn this video, Team USA‚Äôs head diving coach Drew Johansen explains the three major components he uses to guide his athletes towards smaller splashes: the above water position, the underwater swim, and the underwater pike. \n\nAnd while the sport of diving isn‚Äôt all about getting splashes, a small splash is the perfect punctuation to a job well done.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
