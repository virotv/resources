The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#guthealth #vagusnerve #braineducation\n\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#mentalhealth #brain #braineducation\n\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#brain #braingames #braineducation\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The American philosopher, psychologist and educator believed children to be active contributors and agents of their learning, and not just passive recipients of knowledge of previous generations. He believed that for knowledge to be acquired successfully, learning should be an experience. His Experiential Learning approach was based on four core principles.

    "description": "What Is Aerobic Respiration? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool\n\nRespiration is the chemical process that supplies the body with energy for all other life processes: growth and repair of cells, muscle contraction, protein synthesis, sending nerve impulses, absorbing molecules in active transport to name just a few. \n\nIt happens in ALL living cells, not just animal cells but also plant cells. \n\nThere are two types of respiration: aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic means ‚Äúwith air‚Äù and so needs oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration doesn‚Äôt need oxygen. \n\nAerobic respiration releases energy in cells by breaking down food substances whilst in the presence of oxygen. It is represented by this simplified equation \nGlucose + Oxygen ----- Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy. \n\nGlucose is broken down by oxygen to release the by-products of carbon dioxide and water. Energy is released, which is then used to make a special energy molecule called ATP. ATP is how energy is stored for later use by the body. Aerobic respiration happens all the time in all cells, usually in the mitochondria.\n\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool \n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.

    "description": "This is the VOA Special English Education Report, from http://voaspecialenglish.com | http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish\r\n\r\nMore than six hundred delegates recently met in Burkina Faso to discuss education in Africa. The aim is to find ways to support economic growth by improving education and job training programs.The delegates included education ministers and representatives of civil society, business, labor and youth groups. The meeting, held every three years, is known as the Triennial. Ahlin Byll-Cataria is executive secretary of the Association for the Development of Education in Africa. His group organized the weeklong conference.He says there is a missing link between education and employment in Africa. For example, schools need to improve technical training for students who do not continue to secondary education. Mr. Byll-Cataria says educational programs need to be reshaped to better fit the needs of employers. He says this is already happening in some countries including Tunisia, where the association is based. \"For instance, where they have to train engineers, there is a lot of discussion between the schools and the companies in order to know the demands of the company, to take them into account in the curriculum, and even in the management of the schools.\"In Mali, an association of artisans is working to improve the skills of mechanics, wood workers and tradesmen. That association has also helped workers and companies to win government contracts.Several West African countries are working together to develop a network of trade and vocational schools. The idea is based in part on a successful example developed by Nigeria. Mr. Byll-Cataria says educators are working to connect government-run school systems with other groups that are helping educate students. These include nongovernmental organizations, community literacy centers and faith-based groups. Among these groups are Islamic schools, or madrassas, that are expanding what they teach. Another subject for the conference was peace education. The idea grew out of the violence in Kenya related to elections in two thousand seven. The idea of peace education has since spread to countries including Rwanda, Somalia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia.New technology offers a way for Africans living elsewhere in the world -- the African diaspora -- to aid development in their home country. For example, a professor could use videoconferencing to teach a class back home. For VOA Special English, I'm Alex Villarreal.(Adapted from a radio program broadcast 16Feb2012)"

    "description": "Music educator Richard Gill argues the case for igniting the imagination through music and for making our own music. In this talk, he leads the TEDxSydney audience through some surprising illustrations of the relationship between music and our imagination.\r\n\r\nRichard Gill has been Music Director of the Victorian Opera Company since its inception in 2006. He has also been Artistic Director of OzOpera, Artistic Director/Chief Conductor of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra and Adviser for the Musica Viva in Schools Program. \r\n\r\nCurrently the Artistic Director of the Sydney Symphony's Education Program, Richard has frequently conducted for Opera Australia and OzOpera, Meet the Music (SSO), Discovery concerts (Sydney Sinfonia); Ears Wide Open (MSO), and Canberra, Queensland and Tasmanian symphony orchestras. \r\n\r\nRichard's many accolades include an Order of Australia Medal, the Bernard Heinze Award, an Honorary Doctorate from the Edith Cowan University of Western Australia, Hon. Doc. (ACU), and the Australia Council's prestigious Don Banks Award. \r\n\r\nhttp://tedxsydney.com/site/newSpeakers.cfm#RichardGill\r\nhttp://richardgill.blogspot.com\r\n\r\n------------------- TEDxSydney 2011 took place on Saturday 28 May 2011 at CarriageWorks. Tens of thousands of people enjoyed the day: 800 in the theatre, over 1,000 via big screen simulcast in The Forum, up to 48,000 online via YouTube ... and up to 80,000 tuning in to ABC Radio National. It was a grand day. About TEDx, x = independently organised event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organised events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organised events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organised TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organised.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"

    "description": "Out of the bundle of topics that form the syllabus of UGC NET Paper 1 is 'Government and Higher Education'.The term seems familiar to everybody but only a few are aware about it in detail. In India, apart from UGC (University Grants Commission) there are several regulatory bodies like AICTE, MCI, BCI, NCTE and those under state governments. These individual bodies move in different paths, creating various hurdles like exams, teaching methods for students. So we need to bring all important regulatory bodies on a common platform and develop a common understanding and strategy for managing the change.Apart from the government initiative more is needed to be done. It includes promising greater autonomy to universities/colleges, developing brand new regulatory environment for upgrading existing institutions into the world-class category. Besides, one has to re look at the entire range of regulations that impact higher education which includes ‚Äîteacher qualifications, recruitment system, funding system, credit scoring system, teacher progression (API), quality control of private institutions, procedures for financing central/state universities, methodology or schemes for grant of autonomy.So, here, we have come up with some fruitful information about Government and Higher Education Apex Bodies with their brief information to help you prepare well for UGC NET Paper I.\n\nStruggling to find NTA UGC NET/JRF coaching near your home? \n\nJoin India's finest Online Coaching for NTA UGC NET Exam only at https://www.arpitakarwa.com\n\nOnline Courses available for: \n\n‚è© NTA UGC NET Paper 1 (General Paper)\n\n‚è© NTA UGC NET Paper 2 (English)\n\n‚è© PGT, TGT, SET, SLET, DSSSB (English)\n\n‚è© M.A Entrance & Ph.D Entrance (English)\n\nTo get complete details about our Online Courses: \n\n‚è© Call/Whatsapp: +91 7976603731\n\n‚è© Website: https://www.arpitakarwa.com/  \n\n‚è© Email: contact@arpitakarwa.com \n\nFollow us to receive GoNETQuiz & latest UGC NET updates:  \n\nüåé Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/arpitakarwa/\n\nüåé Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/arpitakarwa/\n\nüåé YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/arpitakarwa/\n\nüåéTelegram: http://www.t.me/arpitakarwa\n\nüåé Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/arpitakarwa/\n\n#Government #CrashCourse #NtaUgcPaper1"

    "description": "This is Bubble Education.  A channel filled with original educational songs and animations, creatively designed and aimed for children in Early Years.  Also suitable for children with SEN.  \n\nThe songs are tuneful and the animation simple and to the point.  They are vocal and acoustic guitar based, so have a nice calming character about them too.  I am an experienced educational professional, working in schools for 20 years, so understand the different strategies and techniques that encourage children to engage in learning whilst making it fun. \n\nThe songs on this channel have been crafted around educational schedules, timetables and curriculum and tried and tested with children; proven and successful in assisting their learning experiences.\n\nAs well as several videos covering literacy and numeracy, there are also songs to help facilitate the day to day running of your learning environments:  'Circle time' songs , Good Morning, Tidy up, Hello and Goodbye, Days and Months, Weather, Festivals, Growing up, Feelings, Anatomy, Birthdays, Assemblies...and lots more too.\n\nThe channel is already very popular with children and educators alike. The songs and videos are being used within schools everyday all over the world with over 5 million views and rising.\n\nNew songs and videos consistently added all the time. \n\nA proven and essential resource for teachers and a fun and effective tool to assist children in their learning.\n\n\nAll songs and videos written, recorded, devised and animated by Nick Timotheou\nAll rights reserved ¬©\n\nGOFUNDME link\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-katerina?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet\n\nA little bit about myself:  \n\nMy name is Nick Timotheou and i live in Scotland in the U.K.  I've worked in schools for 20 years now (predominantly additional needs schools) and have used my songs to help assist the children in their learning and development.  It's has been a most rewarding experience, being able to play guitar and sing songs i've written for the children, encouraging and helping them to join in where possible and having great fun whilst learning.  I've also written Christmas and summer productions tailored to the children's needs which has enabled the children to perform to their school, friends and families in an enjoyable and meaningful way.  It's been great to see the joy and self confidence performing has brought them.\n\nHaving some animation skills i decided to produce a You Tube channel so children all round the world could have free access to enjoy my educational songs too.   As well as the children i've worked with, the main inspiration for a lot of the songs i've written is my beautiful 4 year old daughter Katerina.   She has additional needs too and was diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome at 2 years old.  This is a genetic disorder which causes intellectual disability, behavioural and learning challenges and various physical characteristics.  The condition delays speech development - Katerina is presently non verbal, causes high social anxiety and hyperactive and impulsive actions.   She is a great challenge but i endeavor to do the very best I can for my daughter each and every day.\n\nWith the experience and knowledge from my job, i realise how important early intervention is to enable my daughter to reach her full potential.  We recently took Katerina to California to see a leading specialist in Fragile X, who assessed her and prescribed a treatment and therapy plan for her.\nLiving in the U.K., the reality is this will mean a large financial undertaking to obtain the medication and medical expertise from the States, as well as the appropriate therapy she desperately requires to maximise her potential and ease a lot of the debilitating symptoms of her condition.\n\nI therefore decided to start a GoFundMe page to help raise the much needed funds to help my daughter.  There is no obligation to donate, i take great pride and joy that i've worked hard to produce quality videos and songs that presents education in a fun and enjoyable way to children all over the world without asking for anything in return.  However, if you are in a position to do so, then please clink on the GoFundMe links above or below to read our full story and perhaps contribute.  Any donation, however small (even 1 dollar, a euro or a pound) will be very much appreciated and help us give Katerina every chance to live a happy and fulfilling life.\n \nMany thanks for reading and hope you all continue to enjoy Bubble Education as much as i enjoy making it for you all. \n\n https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-katerina?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet"

The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#immuneboost #yogaroutine #braineducation\n\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The result of their research is the film, \"The Finland Phenomenon: Inside the World‚Äôs Most Surprising School System\".\n\nDocumentary | 24 March 2011 (USA) SUB Spanish\nDirector: Sean Faust \n\nThe Education Index, published with the UN's Human Development Index in 2008, based on data from 2006, lists Finland as 0.993, amongst the highest in the world, tied for first with Denmark, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nFinland's education system has consistently ranked among the best in the world for more than a decade. The puzzle is, why Finland? Documentary filmmaker, Bob Compton, along with Harvard researcher, Dr. Tony Wagner, decided to find out. The result of their research is captured in a new film, \"The Finland Phenomenon: Inside the World's Most Surprising School System\". In the 60-minute film, Dr. Wagner guides the viewer through an inside look at the world's finest secondary education system. A life-long educator and author of the best-selling book \"The Global Achievement Gap,\" Dr. Wagner is uniquely qualified to explore and explain Finland's success. From within classrooms and through interviews with students, teachers, parents, administrators and government officials, Dr. Wagner reveals the surprising factors accounting for Finland's rank as the #1 education system in the world. \n\n\nSISTEMA EDUCATIVO DE FINLANDIA\n\nEl sistema educativo finland√©s es considerado como el mejor de los evaluados por el informe PISA de 2003. Dicho sistema se divide en dos grandes tipos de formaciones a partir de los 16 a√±os: la formaci√≥n te√≥rica, que se imparte en las escuelas secundarias superiores y las universidades, y la formaci√≥n profesional, que se imparte en las escuelas profesionales.\n\n\nEDUCATION IN FINLAND\n\nEducation in Finland is an education system with no tuition fees and with fully subsidised meals served to full-time students. The present education system in Finland consists of daycare programmes (for babies and toddlers) and a one-year \"pre-school\" (or kindergarten for six-year-olds); a nine-year compulsory basic comprehensive school (starting at age seven and ending at the age of sixteen); post-compulsory secondary general academic and vocational education; higher education (University and University of applied sciences); and adult (lifelong, continuing) education. The Finnish strategy for achieving equality and excellence in education has been based on constructing a publicly funded comprehensive school system without selecting, tracking, or streaming students during their common basic education. Part of the strategy has been to spread the school network so that pupils have a school near their homes whenever possible or, if this is not feasible, e.g. in rural areas, to provide free transportation to more widely dispersed schools. Inclusive special education within the classroom and instructional efforts to minimize low achievement are also typical of Nordic educational systems.\n\nPrimary languages  Finnish and Swedish\nSystem type  National\nCurrent system  since 1970s\n\n\nSOURCE:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Finland\n\n \n  \"No Copyright Infringement Intended, Strictly For Promotional Purposes Only!

The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#inflammation #athomeexercises #braineducation\n\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"
