If you're interested in improving your sexual health, consider the following general lifestyle tips:\n\nHealthy Diet: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Certain foods, such as those high in zinc (like oysters), can be beneficial for sexual health.\n\nRegular Exercise: Engage in regular physical activity, as it can improve circulation, boost energy levels, and contribute to overall well-being. Exercise has been linked to better sexual function.\n\nAdequate Sleep: Ensure you get enough restful sleep, as lack of sleep can negatively impact your energy levels and overall health.\n\nStress Management: Chronic stress can affect sexual health. Practice stress-reducing techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n\nHydration: Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, as this is important for overall health, including sexual health.\n\nLimit Alcohol and Tobacco: Excessive alcohol consumption and smoking can have negative effects on sexual health. It's advisable to moderate or quit these habits.\n\nMaintain a Healthy Weight: Being overweight or underweight can affect hormone levels and sexual function. Aim for a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.\n\nCommunication: Open communication with your partner is crucial for a healthy sexual relationship. Discuss your desires, concerns, and any issues that may be affecting your sexual health.\n\nMedical Checkup: If you're experiencing persistent issues with sexual function, consider consulting a healthcare professional. They can help identify any underlying medical conditions and provide appropriate guidance.\n\nIt's important to note that there's no magic solution for instantly increasing sexual power, and products or practices claiming to do so may not be safe or effective. If you have specific concerns, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your individual health and circumstances.\n\nDr. Deepak Kelkar (M.D.)\n‚Ä¢ Psychiatrist  \n‚Ä¢ Hypnotherapist\n‚Ä¢ Psychotherapist, \n‚Ä¢ De-addiction Specialist\n‚Ä¢ Sexologist\n\nApp link:- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.manovikas&hl=en_IN\n\nkelkar Hospital is a 100 bedded Psychiatric Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Maharashtra located at Akola.

We earn a commission if you choose to get a certificate of completion.\n\nWhat does it mean to be mentally strong? Well, in the field of psychology, ‚Äúmental resilience‚Äù or ‚Äúmental toughness‚Äù is defined as a person‚Äôs capacity to effectively deal with stressors, challenges, and adverse situations, and still perform well in spite of their circumstances. It‚Äôs also been found to be a significant predictor for both academic and occupational success, as well as physical health, happiness, and life satisfaction. So there‚Äôs certainly no debating the fact that being mentally strong matters. But how do we do it? What are the ways we can improve and cultivate our mental strength?\n\nThere are also a few habits mentally strong people generally don't do. Curious to know what they are?

Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat and let it steep for 10 minutes. Continue to cool until just warm.\n\nOnce cool, strain the ginger and turmeric from the water, into a cup. Add all the other ingredients and stir until the honey dissolves. Enjoy!\n\nTips:\nStir while drinking to keep the garlic from settling to the bottom.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to let the garlic sit for 10 - 15 minutes before adding to heat, after you either chop it or mince it. Letting the garlic sit before adding to heat allows the beneficial enzymes to activate. Once you add it to heat, the heat deactivates the enzymes.\n\nTo keep the vitamin C intact, add the lemon juice only after the tea has cooled. The same goes for the honey as the heat will destroy all the nutritional benefits.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not giving medical advice here as I am not a doctor.

    "description": "Children who experience physical, cognitive or emotional neglect, often face anxiety. As a result, their body produces stress hormones. If this happens a lot, these hormones become toxic for their developing brain, which then later can repress emotional and cognitive well-being for life.\n\nNon profit of Daniel Rucareanu: https://www.facebook.com/federeii/\n\nTREATMENTS\nIf a child is used to suppressing their emotions, because of neglect, it may be difficult to recognize and experience them in a healthy way. Therapists and mental health professionals can help both children and adults learn to identify, accept, and express their emotions in a healthful manner. These treatment options include:\n1. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT): CBT aims to explain to you what's going on inside your brain and how to cope with irrational feelings or fears.\n2. The Hoffman Process: This 7-8 day's guided process, designed to bring participants back into their childhood to reconnect with their parents and make peace. \n3. Family therapy: If a child is being emotionally neglected at home, family therapy can help both the parents and the child.\n4. Parenting classes: Parents who neglect their child‚Äôs emotional needs could benefit from parenting classes.\n5. Psychoanalysis: The aim of psychoanalysis therapy is to release repressed emotions and experiences, i.e., make the unconscious conscious.\n\nSUPPORT us to help raise awareness about neglected children and other important topics\nhttps://www.patreon.com/sprouts  üê¶:\n\nDOWNLOAD video without ads and background music ü§´:\nhttps://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/\n\nSIGN UP to our mailing list and never miss a new video from us üîî:\nhttp://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ \n\nSOURCES and teaching resources üéì:\nhttps://sproutsschools.com/neglect-the-lives-of-the-forgotten-children/\n\nVISIT our website :\nhttps://www.sproutsschools.com\n\nCONTRIBUTE by upvoting your favourite topic or suggesting new ones :\nhttps://sprouts.featureupvote.com/\n\nTHANKS to our patrons \nThis video was made with the support of our Patrons: Johan Klassen, Angela, \nWolfgang Vullhorst, Reynir √ñrn Bachmann Gu√∞mundsson, Daniel Kapuschinsky, \nJonathan Schwarz, Margaret Grace, Bob Wilkerson, Stephen, Mar√≠a, Raymond Fujioka, Hal Beltran, Susan Schuster, Deepak Kamlesh, Margaret Grace, Jonathan Schwarz, Shao Xiang, Denis Kraus, Judy Roland, Bettina Kind, Gatsby Dkdc, Enrique Arellano Farias, Vishruth Harithsa, Nancy Bueffler, Adam G, Tetiana Gerasymova, Raman Srivastava, Daniel Kramer, David Markham, Marq Short, Scripz, Muhammad Humayun, Ginger, Tsungren Yang, Esther Chiang, Badrah, Cedric Wang, Broke, Jeffrey Cassianna, Sergei Kukhariev, Andrea Basilio Rava, kritik bhimani, Don Bone, John Zhang, Mathis Nu and all the others.Thank you!

    "description": "By putting out questionable guidance and whitewashing the Chinese government's handling of the crisis, the WHO destroyed much of its credibility, damaged the field of public health, and failed to contain the pandemic.\n\nFull text and links: https://reason.com/video/how-china-corrupted-the-world-health-organizations-response-to-covid-19/\n\n------------------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/ReasonTV?sub_...\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magaz...\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason\n----------------\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who put a hold on WHO funding yesterday, isn't absolved of his own failures in confronting COVID-19. But there's no doubt that the WHO's response destroyed much of its credibility, damaged the field of public health, and failed to contain the pandemic.\n\nThe WHO's actions in response to COVID-19, in part, stemmed from its overly deferential stance towards China, which is its second-biggest financial contributor among 194 member states.\n\n\"A phenomenal collective action by the people of China to this response\" is how Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-China mission, described China's handling of the outbreak on February 25, 2020, a day after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised China's \"rapid response,\" which he claimed \"changed the course of this epidemic.\"\n\nThe WHO also praised China for releasing the virus's genome while neglecting to mention that it took them at least 17 days to do so. It didn't report human-to-human transmission until late January‚Äîeven though Chinese doctors suspected it at least a month earlier. Although the extreme lockdown of Wuhan likely saved thousands of lives, WHO scientists weren't allowed into Wuhan until 3 weeks after the outbreak first came to light, leaving open many questions about measures the government took in the interim. Meanwhile, the WHO praised the country for its supposed openness.\n\n\"China took action at the epicenter, and that helped prevent the spread to other provinces and the rest of the world,\" Ghebreyesus said¬†on February 15.¬†\n\n\"As China has shown, this does not need to be a pandemic if we take action,\" WHO Executive Director Michael Ryan said on February 28.¬†\n\nAs the virus continued spreading across Europe and reached America, the WHO recommended \"no interference with international travel.\"\n\nOne country that ignored this advice was Taiwan, which also warned the WHO that it suspected that the virus was spreading through human-to-human transmission, yet was ignored. Taiwan, which has one of the lowest rates of known COVID-19 infections per capita, was prevented from joining the WHO as a member country in 2015 by China, which refuses to acknowledge Taiwan's independence.\n\nIn late March, World Health Organization epidemiologist Bruce Aylward declined to answer a Hong Kong reporter's question about Taiwan‚Äîor even acknowledge its existence.\n\nAs Taiwan was distributing face masks to its citizens, the WHO was advising the rest of the world that they were unnecessary‚Äîand initially, the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Surgeon General followed its lead.\n\nBut health experts pointed to mounting evidence that masks can help slow the spread of respiratory disease, especially among asymptomatic carriers, a population that the WHO maintains is virtually nonexistent despite mounting evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn mid-February, the WHO trumpeted good news from¬† China, claiming confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 had declined, ignoring evidence that it may have been a statistical anomaly. U.S. intelligence, meanwhile, believes that China has entirely misrepresented both case numbers and death tolls, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nFinally on March 11, after Italy was already in full national lockdown with more than 10,000 cases, the WHO finally acknowledged the true magnitude of the crisis, declaring a global pandemic.\n\nAs the death toll climbs above 100,000, the global economy remains in crisis, and billions of lives are disrupted, it's important to remember that if the World Health Organization had done its job, the nightmare we're living through might not have happened at all.\n\nProduced by Zach Weissmueller.

    "description": "Are Fruit Smoothies Healthy or Bad for You? Are you blending your way to health or a sugar rush? Discover the shocking truth about smoothies and why whole fruits are the real deal. Watch now and rethink your fruity fix!\n\nIn this eye-opening short, Glucose Goddess, Jessie Inchausp√©, debunks the common belief that smoothies are a healthy way to consume fruits. She explains that the fruits we eat today have been modified and are not as natural as we think. While whole fruits are still the best option for a sweet treat because of their fiber and water content, blending or juicing them denatures them and concentrates the sugar molecules, making them no different from sugary drinks. \n\nShe emphasizes that sugar, whether from a natural or artificial source, is harmful to the body. Therefore, she advises against consuming smoothies and encourages people to opt for whole fruits instead. This informative short will make you think twice before reaching for that smoothie and help you make healthier choices for your body."
