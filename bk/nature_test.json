    "description": "Carnivorus Plant Almost Smashes The Huge Prey.\nMeet the Venus flytrap, one of the most fascinating carnivorous plants in the world. Its leaves are modified into two hinged lobes that can snap shut, trapping and digesting insects and other small prey.\nBut did you know that on rare occasions, the Venus flytrap has been known to capture and digest small frogs, lizards, and even small birds? When an insect or other prey touches the trigger hairs on the lobes, the leaves snap shut, trapping the prey inside. The leaves then secrete digestive enzymes that break down the prey's soft tissues, allowing the plant to absorb the nutrients it needs.\n\nWhile it's not common for the Venus flytrap to capture larger prey, these instances are a testament to the plant's incredible adaptations. So next time you see a Venus flytrap, take a moment to appreciate the unique and fascinating ways it has evolved to survive in its environment."

Add all the other ingredients and stir until the honey dissolves. Enjoy!\n\nTips:\nStir while drinking to keep the garlic from settling to the bottom.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to let the garlic sit for 10 - 15 minutes before adding to heat, after you either chop it or mince it. Letting the garlic sit before adding to heat allows the beneficial enzymes to activate.

    "description": "Simulation: Amidst the bustling party scene on the top of a high mountain, a pregnant woman gently held the hand of a pregnant female gorilla, as a magical bond between humans and nature. Grateful for the presence of the female orangutan, a symbol of wild vitality, the woman gently gave a kiss on its cheek, as a way of thanking nature for giving life to the villagers and to herself. That moment reminded everyone that harmony between humans and animals is the key to protecting the common living environment.\nLoving nature and animals helps us live in harmony with the environment around us.

It is depicted as a malevolent spirit or a monstrous creature with a skeletal frame and long, antler-like horns. The Wendigo is associated with insatiable hunger and cannibalistic tendencies, driven to feed on human flesh. It is often depicted as a gaunt figure with exaggerated limbs, possessed by an unending appetite that can never be satisfied.\n\nThis episode of Rest for the Wicked features dark ambient music and winter forest sounds.\n\n#darkambientmusic #darkambient #darkmusic #wendigo #mythology #creepymusic #musicforgaming #musicforstudying #mystery #creepypasta #monster #horrorstories #witcher \n\nDark Ambient Music Playlists\n\nDark Ambient Music based on Mythology:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Wq7KWLxAJXR8-od0TrHeNl5d9__aWS_\n\nDark Ambient Music based on Historical Mysteries: \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Wq7KWLxAJWcpHR3m3U1q0lp8iosSoL1\n\nDark Ambient Music based on Fiction:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Wq7KWLxAJW3Wr9iag7Na_D6zTqYfurC"

    "description": "Evolution by Natural Selection - Darwin's Finches | Evolution | Biology | FuseSchool\n\nThe study of finches led to the development of one of the most important scientific theories of all time. \n\nIn December 1831 a naturalist called Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle, bound on a surveying voyage of South America. Whilst the ship and crew carried out coastline surveys, Darwin was free to explore the islands en route. In 1835 the Beagle arrived at the Galapagos islands, near Ecuador. What Darwin found there surprised him greatly. As well as giant tortoises and marine iguanas, Darwin collected and preserved a variety of different songbirds called finches. Upon returning to the UK he examined them together with ornithologist, John Gould, and made some fascinating discoveries. \n\nThe scientists observed that the birds were all similar to a single type of finch found on mainland South America, suggesting that these mainland finches had originally colonised the islands. However the Galapagos finches were all slightly different from the original mainland species, and they were also different from each other. The finches on each island showed distinct variations in their overall size, beak shape and claw size. These differences were attributed to the differing food sources available on the various islands of the Galapagos. Some of the birds had long thin beaks, and sharp claws suited to catching and eating insects, whilst others had large powerful beaks suitable for cracking open nuts. Because of the distances between the islands, breeding between different species of finch was unlikely, and Darwin concluded that the finches must have evolved over time from the original mainland species to suit the conditions found on each individual island. In all, 13 of the birds brought back by Darwin were identified as being entirely new species, all similar to each other, but with definite variations from their common ancestor. Darwin proposed that the variations seen both within and between the finch species arose by chance. \n\nVariations which gave any individual a competitive advantage made them more likely to survive and therefore reproduce, out-competing those with less advantageous characteristics. Darwin called this theory Natural Selection and he published it in his book ‚ÄúOn the Origin of Species‚Äù in 1859. Evolution by natural selection is now widely agreed to be the most accurate theory to explain the origin and diversity of all life on Earth.\n\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool \n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.

    "description": "CREDITS\nAnimation & Design: Waldi Apollis\nNarration: Dale Bennett\nScript: Bethan Parry\n\nHave you noticed that you're different to your relations, parents or carers, your next-door neighbour, the kid who lives across the street and everyone else on the planet? In fact you‚Äôre unique.\nBut do you really know why you are different? Why are we all different to each other? Why does any organism have different characteristics to another organism? \n \nThe answer lies in a long running debate called ‚Äònature versus nurture‚Äô, or genetics versus environment, which is a little less catchy! \n \n‚ÄòNature‚Äô refers to our genetics ‚Äì the unique combination of genes that we have naturally inherited from our biological parents, from their DNA. Many characteristics are controlled by our genes, including our blood group, eye colour or natural hair colour. Some diseases are also caused by our genes, for example cystic fibrosis. The colour of a flower or a fruit is controlled by genes in plants. \n‚ÄòNurture‚Äô refers to the effect of the environment on characteristics, the word literally means care. Examples of characteristics that are determined by the environment are weight, or mass, which is dependent on your diet, or the presence of a scar. Some diseases may be caused by environmental influences, such as type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. \n\nImagine that a plant has not received enough sunlight or water. This may influence the height of the plant or the number of fruits produced. We would say that the environment has influenced these characteristics too, or that a plant has been affected by nurture. \n \nThe effect of genetics and the environment on characteristics has been researched using identical twins. Can you think why this is? (Pause). Identical twins have identical DNA, so, in theory, should have identical characteristics. It follows that any differences between a pair of identical twins could be due to the influence of the environment on their characteristics. In fact, twins often grow up to have very different personalities and preferences beyond their physical similarities. These studies showed that many characteristics are influenced by both genetics and the environment. Some studies actually use twins identical genomes as a control to prove the effect of the environment on the body. For example, one study showed how skin aged differently by comparing smoker twins with non-smoker twins. \n\nRemember that the characteristics of a living organism are influenced by its genetics and its interaction with the environment. So both nature and nurture are responsible. \n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
