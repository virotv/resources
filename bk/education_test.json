The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#guthealth #vagusnerve #braineducation\n\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#mentalhealth #brain #braineducation\n\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The foundation of our content comes from Brain Education, an academic study from South Korea that stems from over 40 years of research and application and has been practiced by millions around the world. \n\nWHY WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH‚Ä¶\nWe suffered from high-functioning loneliness and depression our whole lives. We lived different lives in different states, but when we met, we realized we were struggling with common issues that reflected an important problem in our young adult generation. We didn‚Äôt know who we were, what we were passionate about, what we should live for, and what direction our lives were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to go. We spent a lot of time wandering in search of that magical ‚Äòanswer‚Äô that will solve all problems (like I‚Äôm sure most of you are doing right now), and yet the further we searched outside, the more pronounced the emptiness inside of us felt. \n\nMillions of people suffer silently from mental health related issues. Yet our society still places taboos around openly talking about relevant mental health topics like loneliness, depression, and anxiety. As a result, our young adults don‚Äôt know how to talk about it constructively, where to turn to, or what resources they have to combat this real-life threat to their wellbeing. \n\nWe credit Brain Education for giving us the courage to overcome our own mental health struggles and create the lives we want...and now we hope you can too through the videos we share on this channel.  \n\nCONNECT WITH US ON SOCIAL\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://instagram.com/braineducation_tv\nFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/braineducationtv\nWebsite ‚ñ∫  https://bit.ly/2T76bSY\nBusiness Inquiries ‚ñ∫ braineducationtv@gmail.com\n\n#brain #braingames #braineducation\nPlease leave requests and comments down below!\n‚ù§Ô∏èLinda and Gabi"

The American philosopher, psychologist and educator believed children to be active contributors and agents of their learning, and not just passive recipients of knowledge of previous generations. He believed that for knowledge to be acquired successfully, learning should be an experience. His Experiential Learning approach was based on four core principles.

    "description": "What Is Aerobic Respiration? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool\n\nRespiration is the chemical process that supplies the body with energy for all other life processes: growth and repair of cells, muscle contraction, protein synthesis, sending nerve impulses, absorbing molecules in active transport to name just a few. \n\nIt happens in ALL living cells, not just animal cells but also plant cells. \n\nThere are two types of respiration: aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic means ‚Äúwith air‚Äù and so needs oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration doesn‚Äôt need oxygen. \n\nAerobic respiration releases energy in cells by breaking down food substances whilst in the presence of oxygen. It is represented by this simplified equation \nGlucose + Oxygen ----- Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy. \n\nGlucose is broken down by oxygen to release the by-products of carbon dioxide and water. Energy is released, which is then used to make a special energy molecule called ATP. ATP is how energy is stored for later use by the body. Aerobic respiration happens all the time in all cells, usually in the mitochondria.\n\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool \n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
