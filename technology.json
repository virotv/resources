    "description": "The AquaTune Hydrogen Fuel System is distinctly different than the over 200 year old approach to Hydrogen and Oxygen production from the water molecule via Electrolysis.\n\nThis is not traditional Electrolysis- in that- AquaTune is not using high amperage to break the water molecules covalent bond. AquaTune also does not use a PWM(pulse width modulator) which many traditional Electrolysis Type HHO Cells Use.\n\nThe AquaTune Water Fuel Technology uses Hydrogen Producing Capacitors- which produce 2.5 Liters Of Hydrogen Per Minute- while under the vacuum conditions generated by the gasoline powered engine(suction & volume of air flow- past the venturi nozzles- inside the intake manifold). The vacuum signal is maintained(To- The Distilled Water Processor) and facilitated by the AquaTune Venturi Nozzles(Google Search Venturi Theory and Venturi Vacuum Theory). The AquaTune Hydrogen Producing Capacitors utilize an ElectroStatic Charge generated inside the Distilled Water Processor(Think of rubbing your feet on the carpet and then touching something- This is an example of static electricity generation) which acts as an Electrolyte- Thus- there is no need to add Electrolyte such as traditional HHO systems utilize- such as Sodium Hydroxide nor Potasium Hydroxide.\n\nThis system is 60% Hydrogen Production + 40% water mist injection. The 40% water mist injection has a weakened covalent bond from being struck at resonance(Within The Echo Chamber of the Processor) with frequency- in a self generated electrostatic field- within the distilled water processor. \n\nBecause the 40% water injection has a weakened covalent bond- Once this 40% water injection encounters extreme heat and compression- The covalent bond breaks and releases the Hydrogen and Oxygen that is the water molecule. Before this 40% water injections covalent bond breaks in the combustion chamber- It expands the gasoline- absorbs heat- raising(increasing) the gasolines octane rating- advances the ignition timming- then burns :)\n\nThe NASA Space Shuttle stores the less powerful Para Hydrogen(Explosive Power Similar to that of Natural Gas- See CNG). However- through a Magnetic Field which permits an Electron Spin- The Para Hydrogen becomes the much more powerful(2.5 times more powerful than gasoline) Ortho Hydrogen.\n\nThe AquaTune Hydrogen Fuel System does not store Ortho Hydrogen- but rather produces the Ortho Hydrogen on demand(as needed) from distilled water(sold at most grocery markets). There are no Hydrogen Storage tanks on the automobile. The Hydrogen is not under pressure- but rather is generated in a vacuum(Google Search Vacuum Theory & Theory of Vacuum).\n\nOrtho Hydrogen is 2.5 Times More Powerful Than Gasoline- and burns 7 to 9 times faster than gasoline. Ortho Hydrogen is also the lightest Element on the Periodic Table Of Elements. This system does not void new car warranty and will not harm the engine in any way. In fact- The AquaTune Hydrogen Fuel System is good for the engine ie removes carbon buildup in the engine's combustion chambers- and helps keep the catalytic converter and EGR(exhaust gas recirculation valve) clean as well.\n\nNote: In Freezing Weather Conditions. One may add isopropyl alcohol to the distilled water reservoir(1 part distilled water to 1 part isopropyl alcohol) in order to prevent the distilled water from freezing.\n\nWith the AquaTune Hydrogen Fuel System- we do not need to modify nor alter the computer on the car- to permit increases in fuel efficiency and power ie no need for an EFIE(Electronic Fuel Injection Enhancer).\n\nNote: I add two liters of Distilled Water to the AquaTune water reservoir per two tank fulls of gasoline. When I check my oil every other time I fill the gasoline tank, I also top off the Distilled Water Reservoir. AquaTune also offers much larger water reservoirs as well. AquaTune also makes Water Fuel Technology units for Diesel Engines. \n\nNote: It is extremely important that only distilled water be used in the AquaTune units- at all times. Thank you for watching my video!\n\nDirect Link To AquaTune:\nhttps://aquatuneinternational.com/"

    "description": "The 116th installment of the Chicago Auto Show continues to captivate automotive enthusiasts and industry insiders alike, serving as a hub for the latest innovations in the automotive world, with a particular emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs). This event not only showcases cutting-edge developments but also provides consumers with a firsthand glimpse into the transformative changes taking place in the auto industry. \n\nThe Chicago Auto Show serves as an educational platform, enlightening visitors about the infrastructure necessary to sustain EVs. The Powering Chicago team, consisting of the Chicago NECA chapter and IBEW Local 134, plays a pivotal role in guiding individuals through this initiative. They provide valuable insights into installing residential level 2 chargers, empowering consumers to make informed decisions when considering the adoption of EV technology.\n\nHaving established a longstanding partnership with The Chicago Auto Show since the early days of the Chicago Drives Electric Track, the Powering Chicago team has been an integral part of the event's evolution. Now, in 2024, as the metaphorical track expands to feature nine brands of electric vehicles, the need for a robust electrical team becomes more apparent, and the Powering Chicago Team steps up to the challenge.\n\nThe new Powering Chicago trailer exhibit at the Chicago Auto Show is a testament to expertise and innovation within the electric industry. It showcases solar technology, EV charging mock-ups, and emphasizes safety in installations, providing a comprehensive view of the advancements driving the industry forward. This integrated approach at the Chicago Auto Show highlights the synergy between technological innovation, skilled labor, and the future of transportation. And it couldn‚Äôt be possible without the dedication, skill, and hard work of the Powering Chicago team.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - 00:39 - Intro\n00:40 - 01:06 - The Evolution of the Electric Vehicle Track at the Chicago Auto Show\n01:06 - 01:27 - The Powering Chicago & Chicago Auto Show Partnership\n01:28 - 01:47 -  Cutting Edge Technology\n01:47 - 02:43 - The Powering Chicago Exhibit Trailer\n02:43 - 03:25 - Representing the IBEW Apprenticeship\n03:25 - 03:53 - Installing Electric Charging Stations\n03:53 - 04:09 - Outro\n\nConnect With Us! \nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ElectricTVOnline/   \nInstagram: @electric_tv\nTwitter: @ElectricTV\nWebsite: https://electrictv.net/\n\nWho Are We?\nElectric TV is a jointly funded online video platform by NECA and the IBEW where we produce short video features on the work of local NECA contractors and IBEW craftsmen and women. At ETV, we're looking to showcase stories that include NECA & IBEW working together to create the best electrical teams in the nation. \n\nVideo Produced by Oswego Creative\nwww.oswegocreative.com\nContact us: rhiannon@oswegocreative.com"
